<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>In presenting this concise treatise upon castration of the
domestic animals, it is not intended to offer new modes of
operation, but merely to collect together the various methods
in use and leave the reader to appreciate them at their value.
It is a work which, it is believed, has not yet been done in
English veterinary literature, and on this account it is hoped
will prove of interest and use to those engaged in that
specialty of veterinary surgery.</p>

<p class="blankbefore1">In gathering the material, advantage has been taken of
several of the most recent works of French and German
writers on the subject, and plates have been obtained from
the original and excellent wood cuts of Zundel, and Peuch,
and Toussaint.</p>

<p class="blankbefore1">In presenting this volume to the indulgence of veterinarians,
it is with pleasure that the author acknowledges and
offers his sincere thanks to Dr. Holt for the great assistance
he has kindly given in revising the manuscript.</p>

</div><!--chapcont-->

<p>Of all the operations pertaining to the domain of
Veterinary Surgery, without doubt the practitioner
is most frequently called upon to perform&mdash;more especially
in breeding districts&mdash;that of castration, the
destruction or removal of the essential organs of generation
in our domesticated animals. It is, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span>
not nearly so often resorted to for purely surgical
reasons as for purposes closely related to questions
of agricultural and industrial economy, by reason of
its effect upon the individuals of the various species
of animals subjected to it, in order to improve their
value and increase their usefulness to mankind. And
that this is its practical effect is no modern discovery.
As far back in antiquity as seven centuries preceding
the Christian era, it was known and practised upon
various animals. Of this we may find ample historical
proof in the writings of Roman, Greek, and Oriental
authors, where specific mention appears of the
various methods employed, including the processes
of excision, of crushing and of tearing. Even the
castration of females was known to our less remote
ancestors, the Danes having in the sixteenth century
performed it on sheep, swine, cows, and even mares.
The spaying of cows, however, seems to have been
forgotten about the beginning of the present century,
and it was not until the year 1831 that Thomas Winn,
of Natchez (Louisiana), and afterwards Levrat (of
Lausanne), brought it to the attention of veterinarians,
as a means for the improvement of the milky
secretion in cows.</p>

<p>The operation may be considered under two distinct
heads. Under the first it is to be considered as one
of <i>necessity</i>, as when performed with a therapeutic
object in view; as, for example, when it constitutes
one of the first steps involved in the surgical treatment
of strangulated hernia, or of diseased conditions
of the testicles or ovaries, such as orchitis, epididymitis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span>
sarcocele, hydrocele, cyst, etc. In the other
case it is resorted to for reasons of mere <i>fashion</i> and
<i>convenience</i>, and has for its object the production of
such a modification of the general organism as shall
increase the adaptedness of the animals subjected to
it to the uses to which they are applied; when, of
course, the economic becomes the paramount and exclusive
reason for thus interfering with the obvious
creative purpose. It is the operation as performed
under this general heading that we shall now principally
consider.</p>

<p>In relation to this latter object it must be borne in
mind that the operation is followed by certain peculiar
effects, which may either manifest themselves
upon the entire organism, or upon some special functions
only. In the first instance it is quite evident
that the primary and most obvious effect of the mutilation
is to be discovered in the character and disposition
of the animal, which at once becomes in a
double sense an &#8220;altered&#8221; creature, docile and submissive,
and entirely willing to become the obedient
and useful servant of his human master. But it is
not alone that we find the vicious stallion, the uncontrollable
bull, the kicking jackass, the dangerous
boar, and even the hysteric mare and cow transformed
into the useful gelding, the quiet ox, the patient donkey,
and the &#8220;fatherly&#8221; barrow, the quiet working
mare and the productive cow, as the result of the
change which the character&mdash;the nervous system, in
fact&mdash;has undergone. Besides this, other marked
changes are to be observed of a more distinctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
physical character, such as a modification of the
entire organism, manifested in the external symmetry,
and the expressive physiognomy of the creature,
when deprived of its virility.</p>

<p>The animal becomes more quiet, and its general
form is modified. If altered at an early age, the
skeleton will be arrested in its growth, and the mass
of muscles attached to it will participate in the defective
development; the head will become elongated,
the legs will continue to be lighter, and the body
will show a corresponding lack of development. In
other words, the male animal will tend to assume the
characters of the female, in form and feature, the
gelding, indeed, resembling the mare, not only in the
<i>ensemble</i> of his appearance, but in his voice, which
loses the resonance of the stallion&#8217;s, and his physiognomy,
which becomes milder and less expressive;
while his neck is lighter and his mane more scanty,
with the hairs which compose it more fine and silky.</p>

<p>A like tendency exists in other male animals to
acquire a resemblance to the female as an effect of
the operation of castration. The altered bull has a
weak and feminine voice; his head is narrower and
elongated; his horns become lengthened and more
curved; he has exchanged his wild and threatening
aspect for a mild and gentle visage; his neck also is
lighter and his chest narrower; his bony structure
is less massive; and he has, besides all the rest, acquired
a quality of essential importance to mankind
in a dietetic view, that of accumulating fat. This
last phenomenon shows us that besides the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
changes referred to, there is an important modification
of the nutritive forces of the animal, or at least
a change in the direction of their action.</p>

<p>When thus deprived of his virile functions the
animal ceases, in effect, to exist as one of a species,
but maintains an essentially individual life, in which
the assimilable nutriment which he absorbs, instead
of being in part appropriated to the office of reproduction
of his kind, is all devoted to his own individual
conservation. In animals not used for draught
purposes, or in other labor, when the food received
is nearly always in excess of the amount required for
the support of the organism, the result follows that
the surplus of nutritive substances (found sometimes
in great abundance) becomes stored in the connective
tissue and intermuscular structure, and that in this
way the flesh assumes superior and more nutritious
qualities than that of the unaltered animal, while, at
the same time, it loses the strong and peculiar odor
frequently communicated to it by the presence of the
testicular apparatus and secretion in the entire
animal.</p>

<p>This property of modification of function is probably
still better illustrated in the effect of the operation
upon cows, where we shall find not only the power
of accumulation of fat increased by castration, but,
above all, the milky secretion improved both in quality
and quantity, and also in the duration of the flow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span></p>

<h3>AGE.</h3>

<p>The question, &#8220;at what age can an entire animal
be altered?&#8221; admits of a simple answer, to wit, &#8220;as
soon as the testicles can be easily reached&mdash;as soon
as they appear outside of the abdominal cavity, and
are found in the inguinal canal.&#8221; But although it
can be performed at that epoch, or deferred to any
period of after life, it must be remembered that it is
easier and less dangerous in young than in older animals,
and that with the former it is a simple operation,
producing, ordinarily, no noticeable alteration
in the other functions, and but rarely followed by
accidents.</p>

<p>A period between eighteen months and two years
is generally preferred for horses, though, according
to some authors, even a much earlier date may be
chosen, some English veterinarians being accustomed
to operate at as early a date as ten days from birth.
It is immaterial, however, at what precise time the
operation may be performed, since it is a conceded
point that the earlier it is done the better.</p>

<h3>SEASON.</h3>

<p>When it is possible to choose the season most favorable
for the operation, and for securing the best
chances of recovery, the spring, or the early stages
of the fall, are those to which the operator should
give the preference, provided the atmospheric temperature
is moderate and not susceptible to sudden
variations. It is to be remembered that at some<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
periods of the year, without any known or apparent
cause, a tendency appears in wounds to take on gangrenous
or septicemic complications which are not
so generally observed in the mild weather of spring
and early fall. Another essential condition which
surgeons will do well to take into consideration is the
general health of the subject, as in all cases of surgical
interference, any diseased tendency already existing
(perhaps latent) in the patient, such as an an&aelig;mic
condition, a gourmy predisposition, or typhoid susceptibility
are likely to give rise to the development
of serious and perhaps fatal sequel&aelig; to an operation
which, simple as it may be in itself, is nevertheless
not without danger, or of possible complications of
its own.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS.</h3>

<p>The preparations to which the animal is to be subjected
previous to undergoing the operation are the
same as those which are required in other cases of
surgical manipulation. Some portions of the preparations
are, perhaps, of even greater importance,
and may not, on any account, be overlooked, when
we take into consideration the peculiar position in
which the animal must frequently be secured in order
effectually to control his movements. Hence, a low
diet for twenty-four hours preceding that appointed
for the operation, and an empty stomach at the time
of castration, with a thorough washing of the sheath,
are precautions which no surgeon entitled to the
name will overlook or neglect, especially when a soliped<span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span>
is to be subjected to the knife. We shall discuss
hereafter the indications in the case of the castration
of large females.</p>

<h3>RESTRAINT.</h3>

<p>Two modes of restraint are employed in securing
the animals during the manipulations for the removal
of the testicles, one which is applied to all the various
methods yet to be described, and the other applicable
principally to the method of amputation of the
cord by the use of the <i>&eacute;craseur</i>. In the former, the
animal is thrown down and secured with one of his
hind legs fixed in a position in which the inguinal
region is fully exposed. In the latter he is allowed
to remain in a standing posture, and is kept quiet by
the application of a twitch upon his upper lip. As
the first mode of securing the patient is the safest
for all parties engaged in the undertaking, and from
the further fact of its applicability in all methods of
operating, we shall first consider it somewhat in detail.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>By veterinarians who employ the old method of
casting with four hobbles, the animal, being properly
prepared, is thrown upon whichever side corresponds
with the operator&#8217;s habit of manipulation, whether
with the right hand or the left, and the leg opposite
to that on which he is lying being released from the
hobble, is carried forward upon the corresponding
shoulder, as far as it can be safely done. To effect
this a loop of rope or platelonge is passed around
the coronet, below the fetlock, the free end being
carried forward over the dorsal border of the neck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span>
under the neck, towards its anterior border, and is
then carried back under the same hind leg, between
the hinder extremities and over the hock, from the
posterior border, where an assistant, stationed at the
back of the animal, is ready to receive it (<a href="#Fig01">Fig. 1</a>).
By careful, gradual and steady pulling upon the rope
the foot is brought forward upon the external surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span>
of the shoulder, and there secured by two or three
turns of the rope around the coronet.</p>

<p>But it often occurs that in this position the inguinal
region is not sufficiently exposed, and some of the
steps of the operation may thus be rendered difficult,
even when the surgeon has taken the precaution to
pose the body of the patient and place him partly on
his back, by means of bundles of straw pressed under
the side upon which he lies. Many operators prefer
the use of the double side line, with which, when the
animal is thrown, both hind legs are brought forward
together, and he is fixed squarely upon his back, and
the inguinal region thus brought distinctly into view.
The manipulation is thereby made easier for the surgeon,
and, it is claimed, safer for the patient. The
possibility of danger attending these methods has
led many veterinarians in Europe, and in the United
States as well, to prefer the operation with the animal
in the standing posture. But it is to be considered
that the same complications may rise in all
instances, with the exception of apprehended injury
to the vertebral column, which, though possible, is
almost unknown, in fact, at the usual age of the castrated
animal. It is to be considered, likewise, that
the animal, on his feet, is free to struggle as violently
as he wishes, and is thus exposed to the risk of the
pulling and laceration of the spermatic cord, and a
resulting predisposition to enlargements of that body
and the formation of champignons. When it is considered,
again, that by the traction of the cord the
superior opening of the inguinal canal is necessarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page13"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page14"></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[13-<br />15]</span>
dilated, and the formation of a hernia of castration is
liable to take place, we submit the point to the intelligent
judgment, whether, in the presence of these
possibilities of extremely dangerous accidents, it does
not become the duty of the veterinarian to prefer the
mode of securing his patient in the supine position,
both in his own behalf and that of his employer.</p>

<h3>ANATOMY.</h3>

<p>We now pass rapidly in review the anatomical
structure of the inguinal region and of the testicular
organs. A knowledge of these is of course essential
to a proper understanding of the description of the
various modes of operation, and of some of their
sequel&aelig;, upon which we shall soon enter.</p>

<p id="Ref01">The testicular envelopes, passing from the surface
inwards, are represented by the scrotum, the dartos,
the cellular coat, the tunica erythroida, formed by
the cremaster, and the fibrous and serous or vaginal
sac (<a href="#Fig02">Fig. 2</a>). The scrotum is a continuation of the
skin, and forms a complete bag, common to both
testicles, which it contains and covers; the skin being
here thin, vascular and nervous, usually black in
color, almost hairless, and soft and unctuous to the
touch. It is divided into two lateral halves by a raph&aelig;
or median line. It is very elastic, and easily yields
to the efforts of distention, to which it is subjected,
and when stretched over the organs it contains, presents
a shining aspect, due to the sebaceous secretion
which covers it. It easily contracts to its shrunken<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
condition, and may be closely drawn up into the inguinal
canal, when it assumes a thickly wrinkled
surface.</p>

<p>The second envelope, the dartos, is a prolongation
of the tunica abdominalis, and is a yellow, fibrous
structure, forming two distinct sacs resting upon each
other, and lying on the inside of the scrotum, to which
it is intimately adherent.</p>

<p>In the lateral and superior parts the adhesions are
looser, and in front it becomes continuous with the
suspensory ligament of the sheath, which, like itself,
forms a portion of the abdominal tunic. Under the
dartos is a layer of very loose cellular tissue, the
lamell&aelig; of which are so formed that it may be divided
into several superimposed layers. This formation
endows the testicle with great mobility in the dartoid
sac; and these layers may be easily separated with
the finger from the external surface of the fibrous
coat beneath, except posteriorly, where it forms a
strong band which sometimes requires even the aid
of an instrument to divide.</p>

<p>The next envelope is represented by the tunica
erythroida which is the cremaster muscle, and from
the lumbar region extends itself downwards into the
inguinal canal along the outside of the cord, and terminates
towards the superior part of the testicle in
fibres spreading only over its external face. This
muscle, by its deep surface, rests upon the fibrous
coat&mdash;another envelope of the testicle and of the cord&mdash;and
to which it is closely adherent. To the powerful
contraction of this muscle is due the retraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span>
of the testicle into the depth of the groin, which condition
sometimes it is so difficult to overcome in the
first stages of the operation.</p>

<p>The fibrous testicular envelope which we have just
seen giving attachment to the cremaster, is a thin
membranous bag, elongated like the neck of a bottle
around the spermatic cord, which it envelopes, and
dilated below, in order to enclose the testicle. Lined
internally by the serous coat, to which it intimately
adheres, this last membrane is a duplicature of the
peritoneum, drawn downwards by the testicle when
it descends from the abdominal cavity into the inguinal
canal. This serous envelope has, therefore,
two coats, one lying on the inside of the fibrous tunic,
and called the parietal, and that which covers the
cord and the testicle and is known as the visceral.
These two layers approximate towards the posterior
border of the cord, and, as they unite, form a sort of
fold, band, or septum which divides into two parts the
posterior portion of the vaginal cavity, and becomes
a means of solid adhesion between the tail of the epididymis
and the bottom of the sac.</p>

<p>The testicles, thus covered by the visceral layer of
the serous coat, are suspended at the end of the spermatic
cord, and surmounted upon their superior border
by the epididymis, the first part of the deferent canal,
which is folded upon itself, while at its posterior extremity&mdash;the
&#8220;tail,&#8221; so called&mdash;it continues in a
straight course, and conveys the product of the secretion
of the testicles into the vesicul&aelig; seminales,
lodged in the pelvic cavity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span></p>

<p>The spermatic cord is formed anteriorly by the
spermatic or great testicular artery, which forms, in
that portion, a large number of flexuosities, causing
its length greatly to exceed that of the cord to
which it belongs. It contains a network of veins, and
lymphatic vessels in abundance, which are united to
the curves of the artery by a somewhat loose cellular
tissue. A large number of nervous branches, given
off by the solar plexus, surrounds the whole.</p>

<p>Between the lamell&aelig; of peritoneal structure which
forms the posterior septum, and which unites the
parietal with the visceral layer, there is found a band
of grey muscular fibres&mdash;first discovered, I believe,
by H. Bouley&mdash;which exerts a powerful agency in the
retraction of the testicle towards the inguinal ring.
Behind this muscle, and situated on the internal face
of the septum, are found the deferent canal and the
circumvolutions of the small testicular artery.</p>

<p>Having thus considered the essential points of the
anatomical structure of these organs, we shall next
seek to enforce the importance of their careful study
in reference to the intelligent and skilful performance
of the important operation which we are discussing.</p>

</div><!--chapcont-->

<p>The methods of performing the operation of castration
may be variously classified, though in each
class a varying number of modes will come under
our notice.</p>

<p>The first class will include the operations by which,
the envelopes having been cut through, the vaginal
sac opened and the testicle exposed, the organ is
separated by an immediate section of the cord. A
number of different processes are included under
this head, among which are those of <i>scraping</i>, of <i>tearing</i>,
of <i>torsion</i>, of <i>linear crushing</i>, or by the <i>ecraseur</i>,
and of <i>firing</i>, or the actual cautery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span></p>

<p>The second class has also for its first or preliminary
step, that of the first, viz., the incision of the
bags, the opening of the vaginal sac, and the exposure
of the testicle. But instead of removing the organ
by the division of the cord, we proceed as a
second step, to the application of an apparatus designed
to operate by producing compression along
the length of the cord, and in this are included but
two modes of operating, that by the <i>ligature</i> and that
by the <i>clamps</i>.</p>

<p>The third class, according to our category, presents
to our view two further operations, both of which
are essentially bloodless and dispense with the incision
of the bags, consisting of certain peculiar
manipulations which insure the destruction of the
testicular structure, and consequently of its secreting
power. They comprehend the process of the <i>crushing
of the spermatic cord</i>, and that of <i>subcutaneous double
twisting</i>&mdash;the <i>bistournage</i> of the French.</p>

<p>We now enter upon the consideration of each of
the separate modes we have thus enumerated.</p>

<h3>SIMPLE EXCISION.</h3>

<p>This is claimed to be one of the oldest modes of
operating, and though to a great extent discarded by
practitioners of the present day, still finds its application
in the treatment of the smaller animals. With
larger patients, however, though still strongly recommended
by some practitioners, it is not generally employed
on account of the profuse hemorrhage which
necessarily follows the amputation of the cord. Still<span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span>
it is conceded that this hemorrhage, as in many cases
of the clean, transverse section of arterial blood
vessels, will cease spontaneously by the contraction
of the vessels on themselves, and the formation of a
clot at the divided end, as well as in the surrounding
cellular tissue. However, there is a possibility of the
continuance of the hemorrhage for some length of
time, and the bad effects of excessive depletion are
not to be overlooked, especially in an animal whose
general constitution has from any cause suffered impairment.
If there is any one of the various modes
of operating in which the standing position is allowable,
this, in our opinion, is the one, the steps
of the process being so few and so short, and
admitting such simplicity and rapidity. These consist
in making a free opening in the bag, reaching
with a single stroke of the knife into the vaginal
cavity; grasping the testicle and pulling it gently
downwards; and cutting the cord right across, from
the front backwards, above the epididymis, the cord
returning of itself into the vaginal sac&mdash;the division
being made, of course, on both sides. The animal is
then kept quiet in his stall and left alone until the
hemorrhage subsides.</p>

<h3>SCRAPING.</h3>

<p>This operation, which is said to have originated in
India, is but a modification of the preceding. Instead,
however, of using a sharp edged instrument
to divide the cord, the surgeon, on the contrary, employs
a dull knife, with which the coats of the artery<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
and portions of the cord are scraped until the separation
takes place. They are thus placed in good
condition for their temporary closure. This method
is probably attended with a diminished amount of
hemorrhage, and if carefully performed, it may be
entirely absent, the clot closing the artery, and the
condition of the lacerated threads of the vessel acting
favorably, as well, in preventing it. The manipulations
are similar to those accompanying the simple
excision, though it is better and more safely effected
when the animal is on his back. The testicles being
exposed by the incision through the envelopes, the
posterior septum of the cord is cut through by a
transverse section, and the scraping of the anterior
fasciculus of the cord then performed, by a slow
movement from above downwards, along a certain
extent, in order to effect a solution of continuity by
a sort of wearing through the tissues. This operation
is slow and requires a careful hand for its execution.
But as it may in some cases be followed by
severe hemorrhage, it cannot, for that reason, be
recommended for large animals, for solipeds especially.</p>

<h3>TEARING AND TORSION.</h3>

<p>These two modes of operation may, to a great extent,
be considered as identical. Indeed, the mode
of torsion may be said to have arisen principally as a
modification of that of tearing, which is the older.
In tearing, the cord was subjected to a certain amount
of torsion <i>by the hand</i>, and then torn apart at a given<span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span>
point in its length; while in the process of simple torsion,
as properly performed, we obtain a division of the
cord by twisting it <i>with instruments</i>, which enables
the operator to effect the separation at a definitely
determined spot. Tearing differs, then, from torsion
only in the fact that after giving several twists to the
cord in order to gather its fibres into a more compact
mass, and to diminish the resistance of the more
superficial layers, it is divided in its continuity by a
violent traction upon its fibres in the direction of its
length.</p>

<p>In this process, especially applied to ruminants,
the testicle being exposed, the operator secures the
cord firmly with the thumb and index finger of one
hand, to prevent the traction from taking effect too
far upwards when being made by the other hand,
after the cord has been twisted a few times on itself.</p>

<h3>TORSION.</h3>

<p>In this method of castration the cord is twisted
with sufficient force to cause it to break of itself at
the point of the greatest violence. Its design is to
accomplish the removal of the testicle without dragging
or excessive traction upon the cord, and thus to
avoid the hemorrhage following the torsion of the
spermatic artery, as a mode of hemostasis sufficient
to prevent the flow of blood attendant upon the rupture
of the cord. The operation may be performed
either above or below the epididymis, or may consist
simply in the torsion of the artery alone. At
first the hands only were called upon to act in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
manipulations, and the operation was from this
cause known as <i>free torsion</i>, until about fifty years
ago, when instruments were introduced into general
practice, and gave rise to the plan of <i>limited torsion</i>.</p>

<h3>FREE TORSION.</h3>

<p><i>Free torsion</i>, or that in which the hands alone are
employed in the operation, may be performed, as
before stated, either above or below the epididymis.</p>

<p><i>Above the Epididymis.</i>&mdash;The first is one of the oldest
modes of castration known; one which must have
been practiced contemporaneously with the use of
clamps, or in the first age of surgery. The first steps
of the operation required for the exposure of the
testicles are the same as have already been detailed.
When this is accomplished the steps of torsion and
rupture are then performed in the following manner:
The operator, grasping the testicle, carefully draws
out the spermatic cord, and with a pointed bistoury
makes a transverse incision, above the tail of the
epididymis, through the posterior septum of the
cord, involving what we know as the white muscle of
Bouley, the efferent canal, and the small testicular
artery. He then seizes the anterior fasciculus of the
cord between the thumb and index finger of the left
hand, squeezing it as tightly as possible, and having
with the other hand secured the cord at a short distance
below the point where the left hand has already
been placed, performs the torsion by a rotatory
movement given to the testicle itself, the motion
having for its result the twisting and tearing of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
cord when long enough continued to overcome the
tenacity of its fibres. Fifteen or twenty turns of the
organ will usually be found sufficient to effect the
rupture. A considerable degree of strength in the
fingers is required in this movement, and for this
reason the torsion may take effect further up than
may be desired, and beyond the point designed,
which may result in an unnecessary amount of irritation
and injury. When the torsion has gone so far
that the rupture of the cord has been effected, the
stump is released, and retracts in the inguinal canal
to a certain height limited by the presence of the
posterior septum, which holds it in place, and to a
great extent prevents its return through the superior
orifice of the inguinal canal.</p>

<p><i>Below the Epididymis.</i>&mdash;This, the fourth step of the
operation, consists in the separation of the testicle
from the epididymis and the torsion of one upon the
other. The testicle being exposed, the operator,
taking hold of its appendix, the epididymis, with the
left hand, and of the gland with the right, their cellular
serous attachment is divided by the thumbs from
the posterior to the anterior extremity, from the tail
to the head of the twisted efferent canal. If this
cannot be done with the hand, the convex bistoury
must be called into action. This accomplished, the
head of the epididymis is firmly secured with the
fingers of the left hand, and the right hand, left free,
gives to the testicle the number of rotatory motions
necessary to separate it from its excretory canal&mdash;that
is, from eight to ten. When the testicle is thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
severed, the stump of the end, with the epididymis,
is pushed back into the vaginal sac, where it is confined
by the application of a suture upon the middle
of the edge of the scrotal wound.</p>

<h3>LIMITED TORSION.</h3>

<p><i>Limited Torsion Above the Epididymis.</i>&mdash;As we have
seen, this is the operation by which the division of
the spermatic cord is effected by torsion made upon
a given point in its length, and limited by the use of
special instruments.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig03">

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>We have already called attention to the difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
of the operation of free torsion, which requires a
great deal of strength, and which, besides, may be
accompanied by a serious inflammatory condition of
the parts, through rough manipulations of the cord.
It is for this reason that this mode of procedure
must have been reserved for small animals, as, if
performed upon the larger kinds, it can only be by
men whose muscular force is sufficient to enable
them to overcome and bring into subjection the
struggling subjects of their operations.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>It was in 1883 that two French veterinarians,
Renault and Delafond, of the Alfort school, introduced
the use of instruments in the operation, as an
improvement upon the manual methods and their
effects on the sequel&aelig;, though it is said to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
already practiced in Germany as far back as the last
century. The instruments employed are two forceps
of peculiar construction, and which were more or
less modified, one of which (<i>fixing</i> forceps, <a href="#Fig03">Fig. 3</a>,)
is to be applied upon a fixed point of the cord, where
it is suffered to remain, and the other (<i>moving</i> forceps,
<a href="#Fig04">Fig. 4</a>,) is employed to accomplish the rotation of
the testicle and the lower end of the cord. Those of
Renault and Delafond or of Reynal are now in general
use. Those of Beaufils (<a href="#Fig05">Fig. 5</a>) are, we believe,
too complicated for general use.</p>

<p class="caption secondary center">COMBINED FORCEPS OF M. BEAUFILS.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p><i>Modus Operandi.</i>&mdash;In the first step of the operation,
the ordinary manipulations of the division of
the envelopes, the opening of the sac and exposure
of the testicle being accomplished, and the envelopes
being carefully pushed upwards, the torsion and excision
of the cord are effected in the following manner:
The entire cord is embraced by the fixing forceps
(see <a href="#Fig06">Fig. 6</a>), or only its anterior fasciculus if the posterior
septum has been cut, as in the process by free
torsion above the epididymis. An assistant, seizing it
from before backwards between its open branches
and strongly closing them, holds it firmly, without
pulling upon the cord. The operator then grasps
the cord with the moving forceps above the testicle,
and a little below the point held by the assistant,
leaving a small space between the instruments, and
closing his own tightly, begins the movement of torsion,
which he directs from left to right. For this
he sometimes requires both hands, one of them keeping
the instrument in place, while the other continues<span class="pagenum" id="Page29"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page30"></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[29-<br />31]</span>
the rotation as described. Ten or fifteen turns of the
forceps are usually sufficient to complete the rupture
of the cord, the artery, owing to its facility of elongation,
being the last part to give way. The testicle<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
then separates, being held in the branches of the
moving forceps; the fixing forceps are removed, and
the cord is drawn upwards into the vaginal sac. It
is important in this operation to caution the assistant
against drawing on the cord during the struggles
of the animal, consequent upon the pain caused by
the first application of the instruments, and the
pressure upon the parts when held between their
inflexible iron jaws; but on the contrary, to maintain
it as closely as possible against the inguinal region.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig06">

<p class="caption main"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></p>

<p class="caption secondary center">OPERATION OF LIMITED TORSION.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>This process of castration is one of the most rapid
of all the forms of operating. The only hemorrhage
likely to occur is merely that of the small testicular
artery, if it should happen to be divided when the
torsion is confined to the front portion of the cord.</p>

<p><i>Below the Epididymis.</i>&mdash;This process differs from
the preceding only in the fact that instead of holding
the cord between the fingers, it is held by the fixed
forceps, the use of the moving instrument being rendered
unnecessary by the slightness of the adhesion
of the seminal gland to its appendix.</p>

<p class="caption secondary center">VARIOUS KINDS OF ECRASEURS.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<h3>LINEAR CRUSHING.</h3>

<p>The originator of the use of that peculiar instrument,
the ecraseur (<a href="#Fig07">Fig. 7</a>), so valuable an adjunct
in the operation of castration, is Mr. H. Bouley,
who brought it into use at a date as early as the
year 1857. It is not, therefore, an American invention,
as has sometimes been claimed. The function
of this instrument is to effect the division of living
parts without hemorrhage. The original ecraseur<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
of Chassaignac has received many modifications, all
of which, however, operate upon the same principle
The essential design of all is to produce a general
constriction of the blood vessels, by which their internal
and middle coats being first divided, may contract
within the cavity of the vessel in such a manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
as to close their cavity and form a sort of stopper to
the artery, while the external cellular covering, the
last to undergo division, is so stretched, under the
action of the instrument, and so closely adapts itself
by its ends, that insufflation through the free ends
of the vessels fails to remove the closing arrangement
of the two coats first divided.</p>

<div class="figcenter w250" id="Fig08">

<p class="caption main"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span></p>

<img src="images/illo035.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="448" />

<p class="caption secondary center">HOUSE CLAMPS.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p><i>Modus Operandi.</i>&mdash;The operation is comparatively
a very simple one. The testicle being exposed, as
in all the other methods, the chain of the instrument
is so placed around the cord that the pressure takes
place upon the greater mass of tissue, in order that
it may continue the longer; which being done, the
lever of the instrument is brought into action, and
the constriction caused by the chain slowly kept up
until the definite division of the tissue is accomplished.
The essential condition of success in the
operation, having in view the desired hemostatic effect,
is to <i>act slowly</i>. According to Prof. Bouley, an
interval of several seconds should be suffered to
elapse after each rotation of the wheel which moves
the chain. If the tissues are divided too rapidly,
the section of the artery is apt to be too clean, and
a hemorrhage is likely to be the result. This objection,
however, though made by one of the highest
authorities in veterinary surgery, does not seem to be
justified by the results obtained by American operators,
most of whom both recommend and practice its
execution as rapidly as possible; and according to
their own statements, a serious hemorrhage is seldom
encountered. The fact that it has been observed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
any case, however, confirms the wisdom of the recommendation
of Prof. Bouley, and as most of our American
<i>confr&egrave;res</i> prefer the operation with the animal in
the standing posture, the reason of their neglect of
the prudent and more truly surgical process can be
readily appreciated. To avoid the hemorrhage Dr.
House invented a clamp which he applied upon the
cord previous to the amputation with the ecraseur
(<a href="#Fig08">Fig. 8</a>). This mode of castration is not very extensively
practiced by European practitioners. The
reason of this is probably to be looked for in the
essential necessity of safety which so protracts its
performance.</p>

<h3>FIRING.</h3>

<p>This mode of castration consists in the application
to the cut end of the testicular cord&mdash;previously<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
divided with the bistoury, or by the cautery&mdash;as
a means of hemostasis, of an iron heated to a
white heat&mdash;the actual cautery. This is claimed to
be one of the oldest modes of operating, Vegetius<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
and Absyrtus describing it as a common process of
castration. It is much in favor in England, and in
some parts of Germany, though less practiced in
some other parts of Europe. The instruments essentially
needed for the operation of castration by
firing are two; the first, a peculiar forceps for holding
the cord and securing it while the application of
the cautery is being made; and the second, the iron
or cautery itself.</p>

<p class="caption secondary center">DOUBLE FORCEPS FOR CASTRATION BY FIRING.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>These forceps, or nippers, are either single or double
(<a href="#Fig09">Fig. 9</a>), and may be made either of wood or of iron,
and more or less modified in form, according to the
fancies of the different operators. But they all work
on the same principle, and effect the same object.
With the single forceps but one cord can be treated
at a time, but with the double instrument both cords
may be secured at once, and may be divided and
cauterized at one step. In this way the possibility
of disturbing the eschar caused by the cauterization
of one cord while manipulating the second, is quite
obviated.</p>

<p>When the testicles, either or both, have been exposed,
the mass of the cord is fixed between the jaws
of the forceps, from before backwards, at about one
inch above the tail of the epididymis, and firmly secured.
This may be effected either by tying it
tightly with a string wound about the handles, or by
means of a spring crank with which some instruments
are furnished. The testicle is then amputated,
either by a stroke of the bistoury, or with the sharp
edge of the cautery carried across and at a right<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
angle with the direction of the cord. This done, the
operator applies the broad portion of the iron over
the entire surface of the stump of the spermatic cord,
and cauterizes (or sears) the part thoroughly. It
must be remembered that to insure the safety of the
cauterization, the iron must be very hot. Otherwise,
when it is removed, if it has cooled off, it may adhere
to the carbonized surface, and the scab formed
at the end of the blood vessel may accompany the
instrument. The application of pulverized rosin to
the end of the cord, previous to the cauterization, is
recommended by some practitioners.</p>

<p>A very proper precaution, and one on no account
to be omitted, is the protection of the surrounding
parts from the radiating heat by covering them with
wet cloths.</p>

<p>When the operation is completed, the forceps
should be opened with great care, in order to ascertain
whether all hemorrhage has ceased, and the
cord may be allowed to retract. If any oozing of
blood appears at the point of the operation, the cauterization
must be repeated at the point indicated.</p>

<p>A free application of cold water, in the form of a
<i>douche</i>, after the operation, will contribute to the
formation of a clot in the cauterized artery.</p>

</div><!--chapcont-->

<p>Having completed the consideration of the various
methods included in the first class, we propose next
to examine those entering into the second, which
embrace those in which certain means of pressure
are applied and suffered to remain upon the cord
previous to the amputation of the testicle. These
are two in number, and consist of the process known
as that of the clamps, and that which involves the
use of the ligature.</p>

<h3>THE METHOD BY THE CLAMPS.</h3>

<p>This is an ancient mode of operating, having been
transmitted to us through many ages. It has received
the sanction of long practice, and, if not<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
absolutely superior to all others, is possessed of
qualities and advantages which all who have employed
it will freely acknowledge.</p>

<p>It is performed in two ways. One is the process of
the <i>covered</i>, the other of the <i>uncovered</i> testicle. The
covered operation is that in which only a portion of
the testicular envelopes are divided, the scrotum and
the dartos, the gland being left covered with the other
envelopes. On the other hand, in the uncovered
operation, all the enveloping membranes are divided,
and the testicle is made to protrude outside of the
vaginal sac. The first three steps of this mode of
operating are understood to have been performed in
the methods which we have already considered as
generally preliminary in all cases, in order to obtain
access to the cord.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig10">

<p class="caption secondary center">INTERNAL FACE OF CLAMPS.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The instruments necessary to operate in this case
are a very sharp convex bistoury, a pair of clamps,
some strong twine, a castrating forceps and a pair of
scissors. The clamps are wooden or metallic pincers,
formed to embrace the cord and to be applied firmly
upon it, in order to hold it securely, and to confine
the artery tightly enough to prevent the occurrence
of hemorrhage. The form most ordinarily used, and
probably most convenient, is made of wood, and consists
of two semi-cylindrical pieces (<a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>) joined at
one end and resting together by a flat and sometimes
grooved surface, and measuring about six inches in
length. The material is a light but strong wood.
They are rounded at the extremities, in order to avoid
chafing the soft tissues. A groove at each end is designed<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
to receive the twine, which is part of the appliance.
Before being used they are tightly tied
together at one end, in such a manner that they
spring open if closed. This point is one of the first
importance. It requires considerable exercise of
strength to place them tightly enough on the cord
they are to hold, but this firm juxtaposition, so obtained,
facilitates their removal, when that is required.
The groove which they carry on their flat surface
is sometimes filled with some merely lubricating
greasy substance, usually simple ointment, fresh
lard, butter, or cream, though some veterinarians
use a caustic paste. This last mode of proceeding
is strongly opposed by some authorities, as likely to
induce unnecessary inflammatory action, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
the formation of a scab, which may require for its
removal a process of sloughing, which may in some
cases give rise to serious complications. As I have
stated, the clamps are not always made of wood, and
very many alterations and improvements, so called,
have been from time to time brought forward. In <a href="#Fig11">Fig.
11</a> a few of these clamps are presented. The oldest
form is the simplest, and possesses the further advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
of being always easy to be obtained, while the
more complicated contrivances are not always easy
of access.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p class="allclear">The castrating forceps (<a href="#Fig12">Fig. 12</a>) are used for bringing
the clamps together while they hold the spermatic
cord between their branches. There are several kinds
of these, but in default of obtaining them readily, the
operator may find an eligible substitute in the blacksmith&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page44">[44]</span>
nippers or the gasfitter&#8217;s tongs. We have
used this latter for a good many years, and have
found it very well adapted to the purpose required,
by the presence of its set of double curved and grooved
jaws. The twine which it is necessary to use to
keep the clamps closed when they have been brought
into perfect contact with the castrating forceps, must
be soft and strong. A piece of fishing line, previously
waxed, will answer the purpose very well. In order to
facilitate the traction which may be necessary to keep
the clamps in place, it is a good precaution to attach
the ends of the twine to small wooden handles
to protect the hands from cutting by the string. It
is well, also, to prepare a reserve of clamps and twine
against accidents from breakage or the mislaying of
these articles.</p>

<h3>COVERED OPERATION.</h3>

<p><i>Modus Operandi.</i>&mdash;The animal being thrown on
either side, as already described, and kept as
nearly as possible on his back by bundles of
straw packed under him on the lower side, and
the right hind leg secured in its proper position, and
the instruments placed within easy reach, the surgeon
proceeds with the fourfold steps of the operation,
consisting first, in the prehension of the left
testicle, or lowest in position; second, the incision
through the envelopes; third, the enucleation of the
testicle; and fourth, the application and constriction
of the clamps.</p>

<p><i>First step.</i>&mdash;The operation must always begin with<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
the prehension of the gland which corresponds with
the side&mdash;the lower&mdash;upon which the animal is lying.
This obviates any danger of interference by any little
hemorrhage which might occur, and so facilitates the
application of the clamps. Then, placing himself
toward the back of the patient, the operator reaches
over and grasps the lower testicle with both hands,
bringing it downwards in such a manner as to stretch
the scrotum over its surface. This manipulation is
not always of easy performance, the contraction of
the cremaster muscle being sometimes so powerful
that the gland successfully resists all the operator&#8217;s
efforts of traction. It is sometimes necessary to divert
the attention of the animal, in order to facilitate
this part of the process, by pricking him with a pin
on the lips or about the anus, the effect of the new
sensation being such that his opposition is withdrawn,
and the contraction ceasing, he suffers passively the
traction of the envelopes over the organ. Or, the
same advantage may be obtained by the inhalation
of a little ether or chloroform. Then grasping the
cord with the left hand and bringing the organ well
forward, the surgeon proceeds to the</p>

<p><i>Second step</i>, or that of the incision of the envelope.
Holding the sharp convex bistoury in his right hand,
he takes, with the thumb, a <i>point d&#8217;appui</i> upon the
prominent organ, and carries it carefully over the
surface of the scrotum in a direction parallel with
the median raph&egrave; (<a href="#Ref01">described</a> in the first chapter), and
following the great curvature of the testicle, and being
careful with the first movement of the instrument<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
to divide only the scrotal skin and the dartos,
until the most superficial layers of the cellular tissue
of the third testicular envelope are reached. The
skin and the dartos being divided, the edges of the
wound separate, and the testicle, still pressed downwards
and outwards with the left hand, protrudes
more or less, still included, as it is, within its fibrous
covering. A careful dissection, with a few light
strokes of the bistoury, or laceration with the thumb
nail of the hand, now suffices for the separation of
the fibrous envelope from its external covering, an
entire separation of both of which can thus be easily
obtained by pressing the most external layer upwards
through the laceration of the cellular coat
which unites them.</p>

<p><i>Third step.</i>&mdash;The operator now relieves himself of
his instrument&mdash;not, we may venture to suggest, by
placing it between his teeth, as some careless surgeons
are apt to do, but by handing it to an assistant&mdash;and,
changing his position, places himself in front
of the inguinal region, and facing it. He then proceeds
to the enucleation of the testicle, by separating
the adhesion which exists between the internal
face of the dartos and the external surface of the
cremaster muscle and of the fibrous tunic. The
separation being completed, and the scrotum and
dartos being carefully pushed upwards, the patient
is now ready for the last step of the operation.</p>

<p><i>Fourth step.</i>&mdash;The testicle, well enucleated from its
superficial envelopes, but still covered by the fibrous
coat, and the vaginal sac still remaining intact, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
operator, facing, as before, the inguinal region, proceeds
to the application of the clamps. The cutaneous
covering and the dartos being pushed well upwards,
the clamp is placed upon the cord above the
epididymis, from before backwards, the assistant,
armed with the castrating forceps, taking both of its
branches between the jaws of that instrument, carefully
bringing them together, and closing them as
tightly as possible. The instant of the pressure of
the clamp upon the cord is marked by very severe
pain, and the suffering animal is excited to powerful
struggling. It is important that the assistant should
be aware of this, and he should be forewarned to refrain
from pulling on the cord, and reminded, in
order to avoid injury from this accident, to keep the
clamps and the forceps steadily in contact with the
inguinal canal. It is probably with a view to the
avoidance of this possible injury that the use of a
peculiarly constructed vise or forceps has been recommended.
The forceps being in place, and tightly
confining the branches of the clamps, well adjusted,
the operator now applies the twine, and after taking
several turns around the grooves of the free ends of
the clamps, secures it carefully with a double knot.</p>

<p>The operation is then repeated on the right or uppermost
testicle in the same manner, and with the
same precautions.</p>

<h3>UNCOVERED OPERATION.</h3>

<p>The four steps of this operation are the same as
those of the previous method, the first requiring the<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
same manipulations and observing the same order,
but the second involving some variations. In this
the same careful dissection is dispensed with, and
one free incision suffices, including all the various
envelopes, in order to expose the testicle freely and
at once. The incision is made with one free stroke
of the bistoury extending from the posterior to the
anterior extremity of the testicle, and dividing at
once scrotum, dartos, and the fibrous and serous
coats. Though this is to be done without hesitation,
it is by no means necessary to adopt the practice of
some operators, who not only divide the envelopes,
but even make a large incision in the testicular
structure itself, inflicting thus an unnecessary amount
of pain from which the animal might, with a little
care, have been spared.</p>

<p>When the surgeon reaches the third step of the
operation, and seizes the testicle with the right hand,
in order to draw it downward and outside of the
vaginal sac, he may encounter great resistance to his
traction, from the powerful opposition of the white
muscular tissue running along the posterior septum
of the cord. He must then slowly and steadily draw
the testicle down, and at a given moment, with a
single stroke with a sharp pointed bistoury, divide
the serous band of the posterior septum, cutting at
once the muscular fibres, the efferent canal and the
small testicular artery. This being effected, the resistance
will terminate, and the testicle may be
drawn down without further difficulty. The division
of the septum is not always resorted to. Still, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
verdict of experience is strongly in favor of the measure.
The application of the clamps (<a href="#Fig13">Fig. 13</a>) is
effected in the same manner as in the covered operation,
but in this instance the clamp is placed higher
on the cord. For this reason the assistant must be
especially careful during the struggles of the patient
when the clamps are tightened, the danger of inguinal
hernia at this point being too serious to be overlooked.
The clamps being in place, and properly secured,
the testicles are either left in place and allowed to
slough away, or are amputated a short distance below
the clamps, as the case may be. The parts being
carefully washed out, the animal is allowed to rise,
and is returned to his stall.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig13">

<p class="caption main"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span></p>

<img src="images/illo049.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="416" />

<p class="caption secondary center">CASTRATION WITH UNCOVERED TESTICLE.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>An objection frequently urged against this mode of
operation is that it requires a second visit of the surgeon
when the time has arrived for the removal of
the clamps. Estimating this objection at its proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span>
value, we consider that it is more than balanced by
the advantages attendant upon this special mode of
castration, and while we fully appreciate the difficulty
and inconvenience to which the surgeon may be subjected
by this second visit, we cannot approve of its
omission, either from a surgical point of view or in
that of the interests of the employers, in whose behalf
all care and responsibility should be exercised,
until the patient is at least enjoying a fair prospect
of recovery.</p>

<p>The question now arises, at what time can the
clamp be removed with safety? It must be understood
that there may sometimes be peculiar surgical
conditions under which their removal is contra-indicated,
and when they must be allowed to slough off
without further interference on our part. But even
in ordinary cases and under favorable circumstances,
this time appears to vary. By some they are removed
after thirty-six hours, while others allow them
to remain for a period of four or five days. Taking
a fair average, we are of opinion that it may be safely
done on about the third day, and that at that period
the closing of the artery is sufficiently assured to remove
all further pressure.</p>

<p>If the clamps have been secured with twine, and
especially if they were properly prepared previously
to their application, the process of removal is a very
simple one. The assistant, raising one of the patient&#8217;s
hind legs, the operator places himself directly behind
the animal, and bending down, with a sharp
sage-knife, cuts the twine where it has secured the<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
posterior ends of the clamp. If it retains the springiness
it ought to have possessed at the time of its
original application, the branches readily spring
open, and it falls to the ground. If this does not
occur, or if they should be held by adhesions with
some dried parts of the cords which have been pressed
between the branches of the clamps, they must
be carefully separated by moving from below upwards,
when they will easily become detached. But
this last manipulation must be very carefully performed,
if we would escape a hemorrhage which
might require serious measures to control. When
clamps of another make are used, the process of removal
will vary according to existing peculiarities in
the construction of the instrument. The clamp having
been removed from one side, the separation from
the other will, of course, be managed in a similar
manner.</p>

<h3>THE LIGATURE.</h3>

<p>This method of castration consists in the application
of a circular ligature upon the entire cord, or
a portion of it, for the purpose of completely closing
it, with the various parts entering into its formation.
It was in practice so long ago as 1734. The
operation is divided into several varieties, viz., that of
the cord with its envelopes; that of the cord only,
either by the covered or uncovered method; that of
the spermatic artery alone; that of the efferent
canal; and that by the subcutaneous process.</p>

<p>The ligature used in these various modes of operation<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
is formed of waxed silk; sometimes of strong
twine, as fishing line, for example; or, as more
recently introduced in surgery in the removal of living
growths and tumors, an elastic cord.</p>

<p><i>Ligation of the cord and its envelopes.</i>&mdash;This process
is principally used upon small animals, although,
since the elastic cord has been brought into use, a
few attempts have been made to make it applicable
to the larger kinds. The experiments, however,
have been as yet so few, and the results so unsatisfactory,
and in so many cases fatal, that it can scarcely
be recommended, except for small subjects. The application
of this is very simple. It consists, after
securing the patient, in bringing the testicles as far
down into the scrotum as may be thought needful,
and after applying the ligature two or three times
around the cord, a short distance above them (<a href="#Fig14">Fig.
14</a>), slowly and steadily tightening it until a sufficient
amount of force has been employed to close
the calibre of the blood vessel and cut off the circulation
from the parts situated below the point of ligation.
This mode of operating has, in our hands,
proved very successful in small animals, and when
the elastic ligature has been used. Mortification has
taken place in a few days, the testicles slowly detaching
themselves at the point of ligature, and when
falling off leaving but a very small superficial, cutaneous
scab, and healing in a short time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig14">

<p class="caption secondary center">CASTRATION BY LIGATION OF THE CORD AND ENVELOPES.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p><i>Ligature of the cord only; covered operation.</i>&mdash;The
first three steps of the operation having been accomplished,
and the testicle enucleated, the ligature is<span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span>
placed around the cord, still covered by its fibrous
envelopes and the cremaster muscle. A piece of
twine or an elastic ligature may be employed for<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
this purpose. In this operation the testicles are allowed
to remain not less than twenty-four hours, before
amputation is performed, in order that if the
pressure has been insufficient, and the parts should
fail to exhibit symptoms of loss of vitality after that
time, another ligature may be applied.</p>

<p><i>Uncovered operation.</i>&mdash;The only variation between
this method and the one last considered is found
in the fact that in this, the testicle and cord
being exposed as in the process of castration with
the clamp, the ligature is applied either on the cord
as a whole, or only on its anterior fasciculus. In this
case the testicle is amputated immediately after the
application of the ligature. But as there is a possibility
of the slipping off of the ligature, great care
must be taken lest the amputation be performed too
near the point where the constriction is made. And
again, as there is a possibility of the truncated cord
being drawn too far up, even up into the abdominal
cavity, it becomes a precaution of prudence, as recommended
by Mr. Bouley, to leave a sufficient length
of the ligature hanging outside of the scrotal wound,
and even to secure it on the edges of the skin.</p>

<p><i>Legation of the spermatic artery.</i>&mdash;This is a mode of
castration which, if we are not mistaken, was held
in high estimation by certain practitioners in the
city of Boston. It consists simply in the application
of a ligature of silk to the spermatic artery. The
cord being exposed, and the posterior septum being
divided, a curved needle armed with the ligature is
made to pass around the whole mass of the anterior<span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span>
fasciculus, and the entire vascular cord is surrounded
by the ligature and firmly tightened. The fact of
the various and irregular flexuosities peculiar to the
spermatic artery, with both ascending and descending
portions, explains the necessity of including the
entire arterial mass under the ligature, since, if only
the simple cord of the artery were ligated, it might
be an ascending portion only, and the amputation of
the testicle might be followed by a troublesome
hemorrhage from one of the descending loops.</p>

<p><i>Ligation of the efferent canal and the subcutaneous ligation
of the cord.</i>&mdash;These two modes of operating
have not yet yielded sufficient evidence in the form
of satisfactory results to be entitled to more than
passing mention at the present time. We may say
further, moreover, that among all the methods of
castration by ligation, none of them have been subjected
to a sufficient amount of practical test to be
accepted as a process which will justify a strong recommendation
or unqualified approval.</p>

</div><!--chapcont-->

<p>As I have before stated, the third method of castration
embraces the processes in which the testicular
envelopes are left intact, while it is the gland or
cord which is submitted to the peculiar manipulations
by which their structure, and therefore the
secreting powers of the testicle, are so essentially
modified. In treating of this method, two special
operations present themselves for our consideration,
to wit: the <i>crushing of the testicular support</i>, and the
<i>double subcutaneous twisting</i>, or <i>bistournage</i> of the
French. These are employed principally in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span>
castration of ruminants, though efforts have been
made to apply the latter in the case of solipeds.
The modes of operating which we have already described
are, however, also applicable to the ruminants.</p>

<h3>CRUSHING OF THE TESTICULAR CORD.</h3>

<p>This consists in crushing the spermatic cord with
a hammer, the vessel continuing, meanwhile, to be
covered with its envelopes. It was first described
in the year 1826, and is most commonly practised in
some French districts. The instruments used are
two cylindrical pieces of wood, each about one yard
in length and two inches in diameter; and a hammer
or mallet formed of hard and heavy wood. The animal
being properly secured in the standing position,
the testicles being drawn well down into the bottom
of the envelopes, the sticks are placed, one behind
and one in front of the cord, close to the upper extremity
of the gland. When in that position they
are moved in such a manner that instead of remaining,
one in front of the other, one becomes so superimposed
upon the other that the spermatic cord becomes
twisted in the form of the letter S (<a href="#Fig15">Fig. 15</a>).
While held together in this position by an assistant,
the operator, placing himself in front of one side of
the hind quarter, with repeated blows of the hammer
or mallet, crushes the cord at the point where it
rests upon the wood which occupies the inferior
position, of course guaging the force and frequency
of the blows by the effect observed, until the crushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
of the organ is satisfactorily accomplished. As
a measure of caution, it will be well, upon the completion
of the process of crushing, to surround the
cord with a ligature moderately tightened, in order
to guard against the drawing up of the cord into the
inguinal canal, an accident not likely to occur, however,
if the operation has been well performed.</p>

<p class="caption secondary center">CASTRATION BY CRUSHING OF THE CORD.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<h3>DOUBLE SUBCUTANEOUS TORSION; BISTOURNAGE.</h3>

<p>In this mode of operating, principally in vogue in the
southern parts of France, the position of the testicle<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
is so changed that its lower extremity is made to
take the place of the upper, the cord is subjected to
a certain degree of torsion, and then the testicle is
restored to its normal position, to undergo a process
of atrophy which destroys its power of secretion by
a physiological action. The great length of the cord
and the greater laxity of the cellular tissue situated
between the dartos and the fibrous coat, render this
operation much easier in the ruminants than in the
solipeds. Simple in its manipulations, although still
involving a certain degree of dexterity, and followed
by comparatively no symptoms of reactive fever,
the only instrument necessary for its performance is
a piece of cord, twine, or rubber, sufficiently strong
to secure the testicular envelopes when the gland
has been subjected to the double displacement, and
the cord to the torsion it has undergone. In this
operation, no special preparation being demanded,
the animal is usually treated on his feet.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Serres, of the veterinary school of
Toulouse, divides the operation into four steps, viz.,
<i>first</i>, the softening of the bags and separation of the
dartos from the fibrous tissue; <i>second</i>, the displacement
(dislocation) of the testicle; <i>third</i>, the torsion
of the cord; and <i>fourth</i>, the pushing up of the testicles
into the inguinal region, with the application of the
ligature to keep them in place.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The first step is the most difficult for the surgeon
as well as the most painful to the horse, though the
contrary is the fact where the subject is an ox. The
operator, stationing himself behind the animal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
grasps the testicles with both hands (<a href="#Fig16A">Fig. 16</a>) and
quickly draws them down into the scrotum. Holding
them there with the right hand, with the left he
raises the scrotum by the lower part, firmly pulling
upon it downwards and slightly from before backwards.
The testicles are then moved upward and
downward in the sac, carrying with them the fibrous
covering. During this time a peculiar crackling
sound is heard, which is caused by the tearing apart
of the fibres of the cellular tissue lying between the
dartos and the fibrous coat. This laceration is sometimes
difficult to effect, especially in aged animals, in
which case the up and down motion of the testicles
will require a greater number of repetitions before
the adhesions are torn.</p>

<p class="caption secondary center">DOUBLE SUBCUTANEOUS TORSION IN CATTLE.</p>

<p class="caption tertiary center">Second step.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The second step consists in the displacement or
dislocation of the testicle, which is accomplished in
the manner following: The testicles being pushed
well upwards in the vaginal sac, one of them, the
left, for example, is drawn well downwards with the
left hand, which grasps the cord above the epididymis<span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span>
(<a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a>), the thumb resting on the back of the cord,
and the remaining fingers in front of it, while the
right hand, placed in pronation, pinches the inferior
part of the scrotum. Maintaining these dispositions,
the testicles are displaced by the simultaneous action
of both hands, the left pushing the cord from above
downwards and from before backwards, in such a
manner as to depress as much as possible the superior
extremity of the gland, while with the fingers of
the right hand, resting by their dorsal face against
the posterior part of the testicle (<a href="#Fig18">Fig. 18</a>), the inferior
extremity of that organ is pushed upwards. Without
losing hold of the envelope, the movement of this
hand gives way to these opposite and simultaneous
pressures, that of the left hand tending to lower the<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
head of the testicle, and that of the right elevating
its tail, and the gland is being flexed upon the cord
from which it is suspended, backwards and upwards.
At the moment when the testicle forms an acute
angle with the cord, the thumb of the left hand, resting
upon the cord, comes into action to aid in the
displacement by making a <i>point d&#8217;appui</i> upon the
inferior extremity of the organ, which now occupies
the superior position, in such a manner that the
spermatic gland is placed parallel with the cord.
The manipulations are completed by pushing the
testicles upwards towards the inguinal ring, to break<span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span>
up whatever adhesions of cellular tissue may remain.
This second step of the operation being completed,
the two organs are found to be so placed that
they are parallel one with the other, the testicle being
posterior to the cord.</p>

<p class="caption secondary center">DOUBLE SUBCUTANEOUS TORSION IN CATTLE.</p>

<p class="caption tertiary noindent">Third step. Position of the hands during the torsion.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The third step, or that of the torsion of the cord,
now presents itself to our notice. To effect this, the
testicle must be firmly held at the bottom of the envelopes
(<a href="#Fig19">Fig. 19</a>), the left hand placed forward upon
the cord, and the right behind and upon the testicle.
The operator then gives to the organ a twist with<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
the right hand by a motion of rotation from left to
right and from without inwards, while with the other
he draws upon the cord in the opposite direction.
The result of this manipulation is to give to the
gland half a turn around the cord (<a href="#Fig20">Fig. 20</a>), which
thus becomes displaced and takes a posterior position.
By a change in the action of the hands, but a repetition
of the same movement, the right hand now acting
on the cord, while the left is applied to the testicle,
the remaining portion of the motion of rotation
is performed, and a complete torsion of the spermatic
support accomplished. By repeating this action, of
course as many turns of the cord as may be thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
necessary, can be secured, two, however, being generally
found sufficient, although, in a few instances
as many as four or five may be required&mdash;never more
than that. The length of the cord is the principal
controlling circumstance. When these several steps
have been completed with one testicle, their repetition
is, of course, in order with the other. And
when both have been treated, the consummation
of the operation is called for by entering upon the
fourth step, or that of the application of the
ligature.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig21">

<p class="caption main"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></p>

<p class="caption secondary center">DOUBLE SUBCUTANEOUS TORSION IN CATTLE.</p>

<p class="caption tertiary noindent">Position of the testicles and ligature en masse of the bags
when the operation is finished.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>To accomplish this both testicles are firmly seized<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
with both hands, and pressed upwards as far as possible
against the inguinal ring (<a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a>). It is necessary
to be very careful to ascertain that they rest on
the same level, in order to be secure against the
possibility of untwisting. The ligature is then applied
by passing three or four turns of it around the
scrotal envelopes, immediately below the testicles,
with not more than a sufficient degree of tightness
to assure it against slipping off.</p>

<p>The symptoms which succeed the operation are not
commonly of a very serious nature, and subside
within a period of time varying from two to six
hours. Following the operation an inflammatory
swelling takes place in the bags, and after one or
two days assumes large dimensions. The ligature
can now be removed, and the animal left to himself,
without further treatment, the testicles undergoing
a slow process of atrophy readily recognized by their
appearance and the position they always thereafter
occupy in the vaginal sac.</p>

<h3>CASTRATION OF CRIPTORCHIDS.</h3>

<p>The abnormal development of animals in which
the testicles have failed to make their appearance
by descending through the inguinal canal into the
bags, is quite commonly met with in solipeds, the
animal being then known by the designation of
ridglings or originals. The position assumed by the
organ in relation to its normal situation being so
altered that it may be found either partly engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span>
in the inguinal canal (<a href="#Fig22">Fig. 22</a>), or only remaining
close to its superior opening (<a href="#Fig23">Fig. 23</a>), is one of these
inequalities, constituting what is called inguinal
criptorchidy; another being when it remains floating
in or adherent to some parts of the abdominal
cavity&mdash;a condition known as abdominal criptorchidy
(<a href="#Fig24">Fig. 24</a>). As this condition has usually a peculiar
effect on the temper of the animal so affected, often
rendering him unfit for general use, it necessitates,
on that account, the act of castration, with some
changes in the manipulations described for the operation
upon animals exempt from such an infirmity.
In these cases the operation presents more difficulties,
and is of a more serious character than the
former, demanding on the part of the operator all
the skill and knowledge which can be acquired from
its frequent performance and extensive study. That
the operation is one which is largely performed on
the Continent there is no doubt, and many European
operators have made for themselves an extensive
reputation in connection with it. Among these the
name of Professor Degives, of the Brussels school,
merits mention.</p>

<p>But there is probably, on this Continent at least,
no better accredited authority, in this branch of
surgery, than a gentleman, a layman, of Illinois,
known very widely as <span class="smcap">Farmer Miles</span>, who has for
many years not only sustained an eminent repute in
his specialty as a gelder, but I believe, has devoted
a large share of study specially to the castration of
ridglings. He has not only traversed large portions<span class="pagenum" id="Page69"></span><span class="pagenum"

of the United States in the practice of this interesting
branch of veterinary surgery, but has likewise
achieved much renown and appreciative criticism
from foreign sources, having travelled extensively
in various European countries, and earned much
honor from those who have watched his methods,
and received ocular proof of his dexterity and success
within the sphere of his special field of usefulness.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The method of procedure, which has in his hands
proved so exceptionally successful, though no
doubt essentially original with him, is still, we believe,
based upon the same principles which govern
the operation as we find it described and illustrated
in the works of the classical writers who have given
their attention to the subject.</p>

<p>We now turn to the consideration of the <i>modus
operandi</i>, as observed in the two forms of cryptorchidy,
the inguinal and the abdominal.</p>

<h3>INGUINAL CRYPTORCHIDY.</h3>

<p>The preliminary steps in this case are the same
as those which are necessary in the castration of
animals under normal conditions. The instruments
required are a convex bistoury, one or two clamps,
or a ligature, and an actual cautery, or the ecraseur
most commonly in use. To these is sometimes
added a pair of long forceps of peculiar construction,
with jaws terminating in two spoon-shaped extremities,
designed to grasp the testicle when placed high in
the inguinal canal, or if only partly engaged in the ring.
Prof. Degives divides the operation into five steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span></p>

<p><i>First; the incision of the scrotum and the dartos.</i>&mdash;The
operator, with or without the aid of an assistant,
makes a straight longitudinal incision upon the
scrotum at the place where the testicle is nominally
situated, carefully dividing, also, the yellow fibrous
layer which represents the dartos, being especially
careful at this point to avoid the large venous
branches which abound in the region involved. A
sort of hooked bistoury is, we understand, preferred
by some veterinarians for this incision, on the score
of the additional safety secured by the use of an
instrument of that form.</p>

<p><i>Second step; exposure of the external inguinal ring.</i>&mdash;To
accomplish this the loose cellular tissue which
lies under the dartos is torn and divided by the
fingers until the ring is felt. The</p>

<p><i>Third step is the dissection of the vaginal sheath.</i>&mdash;The
sheath being situated at varying depths, the
dissection is effected by carefully introducing the
hand into the inguinal canal, and separating it as
much as possible by passing the fingers around its
external surface.</p>

<p><i>Fourth step; opening the sheath.</i>&mdash;The opening is
made lengthwise, and of sufficient width to allow of
the passage of the testicle. When this organ is situated
high up in the ring, it is frequently difficult to
grasp it and keep it sufficiently steady in position to
permit the free use of the bistoury. The sheath
being opened and all the testicular envelopes divided,
we complete the operation by perfecting the</p>

<p><i>Fifth stage, or the removal of the testicle.</i>&mdash;There are<span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span>
two ways of accomplishing this, viz.: the direct and
the indirect division of the cord. In the former
case the amputation is effected either by the process
of cauterization, by limited torsion, or with the
ecraseur. In the latter the testicle is removed
either by a ligature or by the process of the clamps.
The process by the ecraseur is at once that which is
most generally preferred and the easiest of application.</p>

<h3>ABDOMINAL CRYPTORCHIDY.</h3>

<p>In this severe form of the trouble under consideration,
the various steps of the operation demand
careful study. Indeed, so common, so serious, and
so frequently fatal are the complications which the
surgeon may expect to encounter, that many operators
habitually discourage the interference with this
peculiar violation of normal conditions.</p>

<p>The first two steps of the operation are similar to
those which belong to castration in inguinal cryptorchidy.
Following on we have for the</p>

<p><i>Third step, the perforation of the inguinal canal</i>, or
the establishment, by the operator, of an artificial
communication from without, with the abdominal
cavity within. To effect this the surgeon introduces
his hand, with the fingers united in the form of a
cone, into the external inguinal ring, and carefully
forces them upward towards the external angle of
the ilium, resting them upon the crural arch. He
soon reaches the closed superior inguinal ring, feeling
only the peritoneal membrane, where it is readily<span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span>
torn. Then tearing it sufficiently to permit the passage
of the entire hand, or as large a portion of it as
is necessary, he has reached the</p>

<p><i>Fourth step, or the seizure and removal of the testicle.</i>&mdash;The
hand, or three fingers, are then passed into
the abdominal cavity, in order to feel for the organ
or its appendages, until the location is determined,
whether of testicle, epididymis, vas deferens, or
blood vessels. These are usually found floating
not far from the torn opening of the peritoneum.
But if not so readily discovered, the hand
must be carried above the neck of the bladder,
towards the end of the deferent canal, which must be
followed until the epididymis or testicle is found.
It is then carefully brought outwards by a slow and
steady traction upon the testicle itself, or upon a
portion of the epididymis, or even upon the extremity
of some of the testicular blood vessels.</p>

<p><i>Fifth step.</i>&mdash;The removal of the organ is always
much more safely effected with the ecraseur than by
other means. The operation is completed by the
application of a suture upon the external wound, in
order to guard effectually against the possibility of
ventral hernia occurring subsequently.</p>

<p>Abdominal cryptorchids are sometimes treated by
removal through the flank&mdash;an operation intrinsically
more dangerous, as well as less promising of success
than that in the inguinal region.</p>

<h3>EFFECTS FOLLOWING THE OPERATION OF CASTRATION.</h3>

<p>These will vary more or less in extent and severity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span>
according to the method employed in its performance,
and in any case they may be considered in two divisions;
as primary or immediate, and secondary or
consecutive.</p>

<p>Amongst the first phenomena most commonly observed
is, of course, a manifestation of pain, characterized
by symptoms of colic, exhibited by the animal
in a more or less marked degree, being the result of the
unavoidable irritation arising from the manipulations
practised upon the organs of generation, whose
nerves rise from the sympathetic as well as from the
cerebro-spinal nervous system; and from the pain
excited in the spermatic cord by the pressure of the
clamps, for example. These colicky pains, which are
more severe under the bloodless method than in
those of the other mode, usually subside after the
first hour following the operation, and as a rule require
but little treatment more than that of the
walking exercise. This sort of pain having subsided,
the only further trouble likely to be noticed is the
local trouble resulting from the lesion to which the
testicular region has been subjected. Resulting from
this local lesion, as well as from the rough manipulations
attending the various steps of the different procedures,
a peculiar stiffness will be observed in the
motion of the animal. This may be referred either
to the local pain proper, to the dragging to which
the cord has been subjected, or to the presence of
the clamps, which, resting closely in the groin, necessarily
more or less impede the action of locomotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span></p>

<p>Hemorrhage may also occur immediately after the
operation, either while the patient is still on the
ground or as soon as he regains his feet. This may
be due either to the solution of continuity at the
edges of the wound of the envelopes, or may proceed
from the small testicular or the spermatic artery.
The first two causes of hemorrhage need not engage
our attention, usually ceasing spontaneously, and
never being attended with serious inconvenience.
It is not so, however, in the case of hemorrhage proceeding
from the spermatic blood vessel proper, occurring
after those methods of operating which dispense
with the closing of the artery by artificial
appliances, as is done with the clamp or the ligature,
or which may be observed in castration by torsion,
cauterization, the use of the ecraseur, or especially
by the process of simple excision. Though not necessarily
fatal, the hemorrhage in these instances may
require prompt and effectual interference by the surgeon
for its suppression.</p>

<p>It is not rare for castrated animals to become more
or less tympanitic, a condition which may be due,
more or less, to the introduction of atmospheric air
into the abdominal cavity during the performance of
the operation. This condition of things is usually
remedied by the unaided action of natural causes.</p>

<p>The secondary effects also vary according to the
manipulations of the method which they follow.
The development of reactive fever is an event which
in many cases requires close watching, and while it is
true that many castrated horses will manifest no subsequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
illness, even to the extent of a slight elevation
of temperature, others, on the contrary, show unmistakable
signs of a general inflammatory condition
and this is the more marked and definite as the condition
of the wound has been left in a more or less
complicated state. The presence of the ligature or of
a portion of the cord which has yet to complete the
sloughing action, following the method by cauterization
and by the clamps, are sufficient to encourage
the inflammatory tendency.</p>

<h3>MODES OF CICATRIZATION.</h3>

<p>The cicatrization of the wound of castration takes
place in two ways. While the upper part heals by
adhesive inflammation at and above the point where
the amputation has been performed, it is below that
point in a process of cicatrization by the second intention,
the parts filling up by the development of
granulations, and being accused by an abundant
suppurative process. The first fact observed is that
the parts become more or less swollen. The swelling
is at first limited to the edges of the wound, but
increases and spreads to the scrotum, then to the
sheath, or even extends forwards and backwards to
the perineal region. A flow of serosity will be observed
almost immediately following the operation,
at first thin and yellowish, but will, before the second
or third day, become thicker and more purulent in
character, so progressing that after that period it
will become a laudable, creamy pus, in evidence of
the process going forward towards the establishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
of sound and healthy cicatrization. This cicatrization
will proceed until the healing is complete&mdash;that
is, for a period varying between thirty and forty
days&mdash;the swelling slowly subsiding from the moment
when the suppuration becomes established.</p>

<h3>THE HYGIENE AND THE SUBSEQUENT ATTENTION.</h3>

<p>The moment the patient has risen from his bed
and has been thoroughly cleansed from the blood
that has soiled his legs, it becomes necessary, if the
clamps have been used, to apply the necessary
means to prevent their removal by the action of the
tail. This is done by braiding the hairs shortly,
and sometimes tying it up on the side. Even when
this is not necessary, from the clamps not having
been used, it is better to have the tail tightened up
short, in order, when the suppurative process is established,
the more easily to preserve the cleanliness
of that part of the body. It is recommended by
some veterinarians, also, as soon as the animal is on
his feet, to have him thoroughly rubbed and dried,
lest, as is not uncommon, he should have perspired
excessively during the operation. He may be
warmly blanketed if he has been accustomed to a
covering, or in any case, placed in a quiet stall and
tied up. If quiet and unexcited, and exhibiting no
immediate ill consequences of the operation, he may,
after an interval, be allowed to go loose in a box
stall. If there are any manifestations of pain, or
colicky symptoms, walking exercise may be given.
Quietness, protection from changes of the weather,<span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span>
moderate diet, varying according to his condition,
are included in the only general instructions that can
be given.</p>

<p>The wound simply requires to be kept clean.
Washing with cool water and soap when the discharge
is well established, will fulfil this indication.
The closing of the edges of the wound is to be carefully
prevented by the introduction of the finger between
them, care being taken to avoid the laceration
of any points where union has already taken place
in the upper part of the wound.</p>

<p>It is not an unusual thing to find even these simple
measures of caution overlooked by gelders, some
of them even recommending that the animal should,
immediately after the operation, be violently exercised&mdash;even
put in harness and made to draw a
wagon. It is true that a little and gentle exercise
may be beneficial, with a view to the removal of the
soreness and pain of the newly castrated animal; it
must be admitted even that Professor Bouley recommends
slow exercise to be carried to the extent of
fatiguing the animal. But when we take into consideration
how seriously some animals, at least, are
affected by the operation, and the serious complications
which may follow it&mdash;even laying aside the humanitarian
view of the question&mdash;we must necessarily
conclude that such directions and such a
practice is in violation of all the laws of true surgery,
and even if justified by the strongest statistics, is
condemned if confronted by a single fatal case.</p>

</div><!--chapcont-->

<h3>COMPLICATIONS AND THEIR TREATMENT.</h3>

<p>Though the operation of castration is comparatively
simple in its various methods and is generally
successful in its results, still it is not entirely free
from accidents or complications. Indeed, among
those likely to meet our notice, there are some of
quite a serious character, which will develop themselves
independently of the skill and care with which
the operation may have been performed or whatsoever<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>
attention may have been bestowed upon the
patient. Among these may be enumerated <i>colics</i>,
<i>hemorrhage</i>, <i>swelling</i> of the scrotum, <i>gangrene</i>, <i>abscesses</i>,
<i>champignon</i>, <i>fistula</i>, <i>hernia</i>, <i>peritonitis</i>, <i>tetanus</i>, and
<i>amaurosis</i>.</p>

<h3>COLICS.</h3>

<p>This, we have already seen, usually appears a
short time after the completion of the operation,
the suffering animal becoming uneasy, restless in
his stall, pawing the ground with his fore feet, and
sometimes lying down and rolling. As I have before
stated, these symptoms, as a rule, are of short
duration, and subside without other treatment than
a little walking exercise. It is rarely the case that
they fail to yield to an anodyne, or a dose of chloral
may be demanded before the symptoms are subdued.</p>

<h3>TEARING OF THE CLAMPS.</h3>

<p>When this accident occurs it is commonly attributable
to the omission of a careless operator
to secure the tail of the animal in such a manner
as to prevent its interference with those implements
by its entanglement, and tearing them
from the end of the cord, as a consequence. The
result of this is the appearance of a hemorrhage from
the spermatic artery, which can only be controlled
by either a reapplication of the clamps to the end of
the cord&mdash;if it can be thus secured&mdash;or by other
means, which will be considered when we reach the<span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span>
subject of bleeding in general as connected with
other causes.</p>

<h3>HEMORRHAGE</h3>

<p>May be primary or secondary. In the first instance
it occurs in consequence of the insufficiency
of the means of hemostasis applied to the end
of the cord, as in the case of the operation by
simple excision, by cauterization, the too rapid crushing
of the cord, torsion, or the accident before referred
to&mdash;when the clamps have been torn off and
the cord lacerated about the point of their application.</p>

<p>Secondary hemorrhage manifests itself after a
longer interval following the operation. It may
occur, for example, after the removal of the clamps,
or when, during their removal, the mortified end of
the cord is too much interfered with by the sharp
end of the instrument used in cutting the string
which confines them together, or from too forcibly
pulling upon the cord itself; and in some instances
without any assignable cause other than a diseased
condition of the coats of the artery. This secondary
hemorrhage is usually, by reason of the inflammatory
condition of the blood vessels, of more threatening
aspect and more difficult to control than the
primary variety. The treatment indicated varies.
When caused by the tearing of the clamps, or at the
time of their removal, it may be checked by the reapplication
of the instrument. But if the cord
is retracted within the inguinal canal and cannot be<span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span>
reached, and if it is already adherent to the surrounding
tissues, by granulations recently formed, the
checking of the flow may be very difficult. In many
cases the application of cold water, either in the
shape of the cold douche over the part, or iced
sponges, may prove sufficient. But in other cases
the cavity of the wound must be packed with balls
of oakum, wet either with water alone or any styptic
agent, such as a solution of perchloride of iron, the
whole being kept in place by a suspensory bandage,
or if necessary, a few points of suture.</p>

<p>These measures may be put in practice while the
animal is on his feet; but if they fail in their effect,
the surgeon must at once proceed to cast his patient
and ligate the artery&mdash;an operation of delicate execution,
and not always easy to perform, by reason of
the deep seated position of the vessel. The use of
the actual cautery has also been recommended, but
even when successful there are many objections to
this, one of which is the complication such an operation
may bring on by the introduction into the wound
of a scab which must necessitate for its expulsion a
serious amount of inflammatory action. As a rule,
however, the operation of packing is all that is required,
the oakum being left undisturbed for twenty-four
or even thirty-six hours. Its removal must be
undertaken with great caution.</p>

<h3>SWELLING OF THE SCROTAL REGION.</h3>

<p>This, as we have seen, is an almost necessary
consequence of the operation, the swelling making<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
its appearance a short time after the alteration is
accomplished. It usually first affects the parts
immediately around the edges of the wound,
and spreads forwards and upwards in such a
manner that the entire scrotum and sheath become
the seat of it. It is somewhat warm, tense,
and slightly painful. If there is no increase beyond
these limits, there is no occasion for alarm, as by
exercise, fomentations, and scarifications, with the
administration of diuretics, it ordinarily subsides.
But if it continues to increase, and extends upwards
and backwards, involving the inside of the thighs
and the perineum, loses its character of heat and
soreness, to become cold and painless, crepitating
under pressure, we must prepare to encounter the
most severe of all complications, that of gangrene,
requiring the most prompt and vigorous treatment,
as we shall presently see. It may also happen that
even while retaining the characteristics of healthy
&#339;dema, it may assume such dimensions that the
penis becomes so involved that phymosis and paraphymosis
may supervene, to add to the other complications.
These, however, are not serious sequel&aelig;,
as by proper care, with fomentations or scarifications,
and the use of a suspensory bandage, they
may be readily overcome.</p>

<h3>GANGRENE.</h3>

<p>This accident may be looked for from the
fourth to the eighth day, manifesting itself not
only by the extent which the &#339;dema of the scrotal<span class="pagenum" id="Page89">[89]</span>
region assumes, and by its characteristics of coldness,
loss of sensibility, and crepitant feeling, but
by the f&#339;tid odor proceeding from the wound, and
by a change in the character, or the disappearance
of the suppuration, which is succeeded by a sanious,
bloody and offensive discharge. To this series of
symptoms are to be added a marked increase of the
general disturbance, manifested by increased thirst,
anorexia, f&#339;tid mouth, change of color in the mucous
membrane to a livid hue, increase of pulse, with
weakening, increased respiration, temperature at first
elevated and then diminished, and after five or six
days a final termination in the death of the patient.</p>

<p>The progress of this complication is so rapid, and
the chances of recovery are so few, that the necessity
for prompt treatment becomes at once obvious. All
the diseased and mortified parts must be removed at
once, and means instantly employed to prevent the
absorption of gangrenous matter. Friction with ammoniacal
and turpentine liniments must be used over
the swelling; the parts must be subjected to the
actual cautery at white heat, and disinfecting agents
of all kinds must be freely used, as chloride of lime,
carbolic acid, and permanganate of potash, while internal
treatment must immediately be instituted by
the administration of stimulants and antiseptics in the
form of ammonia and phenic acid, or its preparations.</p>

<h3>ABSCESSES.</h3>

<p>When these are likely to result from a too rapid
closure of the edges of the scrotal envelope, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span>
premature union may be readily prevented, as we
have before stated, by the careful introduction of the
finger into the wound while it is still suppurating.
But notwithstanding this precaution they will sometimes
occur as the result of the infiltration and accumulation
of the suppurative matter. A free incision
and proper attention to the cavity of the abscess, is
all that this accident requires. A careful examination
of the parts will, however, reveal another cause
for the formation of these abscesses. It is then
against these causes that the therapeutic treatment
must be directed. We refer now to the complication
known as the formation of a</p>

<h3>CHAMPIGNON.</h3>

<p>This name is applied to an indurated condition
of the end of the cord, or in its thickness,
of a tumefied character, varying in size and extent,
and slow in its growth. It results from an excess of
inflammatory action, attributable to the manipulations
which become necessary during the performance
of the operation. The name &#8220;champignon&#8221;
(or mushroom) is applied to it by the French, on account
of the pedunculated appearance which it sometimes
assumes, and which causes it to greatly resemble
that fungus in its outward figure. It is also
known as schirrous or indurated cord. The tumor
is sometimes situated on the outside of the envelopes,
when it is known as <i>extra-scrotal</i>, but more commonly
it is found covered by the skin, in which case it is
better known as <i>intra-scrotal</i>. In this latter condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span>
it may be merely a growth at the end of the
cord, becoming, as determined by its location, of an
<i>extra-inguinal</i> character, or if the diseased process
extends as far as the upper inguinal opening, or beyond
it, it becomes, and is so denominated, <i>intra-abdominal</i>.
There is also an <i>extra-intra-scrotal</i> growth,
when it is partly within and partly external to the
scrotum. This tumor will vary greatly in size, being
sometimes very small in dimensions, and at others
having those of a man&#8217;s fist. We have ourselves
observed it equalling a child&#8217;s head in size.</p>

<p>The causes from which it originates are obscure,
and cannot be very well defined. Still, they may be
arranged under the heading of any of the morbific
causes which may excite an excess of inflammatory
action at the end of the cord. Amongst these may
be enumerated all violent tractions upon the cord at
the time of the operation; all unnecessary manipulations
during the process of cicatrization, such as
the too frequent introduction of the finger into the
wound with destruction of the granulations already
adherent to the cord, and the application of the appliances
for its division too low down upon it, leaving
that organ hanging too much, and the retraction
of the organ being insufficient to retain it in the inguinal
sac. Still, as a champignon may be developed
in the absence of all these causes, it would seem that
their growth may be attributed also to some specific
idiosyncrasy in the animal affected, the true nature
of which cannot be very accurately or easily understood.
It is held, however, by certain German and<span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span>
Russian authors that exposure to cold exercises a
great deal of influence in the development of this
affection, and observation has largely established
the fact of its greater prevalence during cold seasons.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms of extra-scrotal champignon.</i>&mdash;This is
otherwise known in the terminology of some pathologists
as <i>true</i> or <i>superficial champignon</i>. It develops
itself at the cut extremity of the cord as a granulating
mass, of a red color, varying in size, its growth,
nevertheless, allowing the cicatrization of the skin
to progress in such a manner that it forms a point of
attachment from which the tumor seems to proceed.
This form of it is usually of little account, as it may
easily be removed before it has attained to troublesome
dimensions. When of considerable proportions,
however, it may interfere materially with the
act of locomotion by causing pain in the cord, upon
which it drags more or less. It is not often or necessarily
accompanied by constitutional disturbance,
excepting in cases of excessive suppuration, which
may sooner or later undermine the general health
by exhausting the stamina of the patient.</p>

<p>If instead of showing its greatest development on
the surface of the scrotum, it occurs beneath it, a
greater or less degree of swelling will appear on one
or both sides of the inguinal region, the swelling being
somewhat hard, possibly the seat of one or more
fistulous tracks resulting from abscesses which have
at times opened, discharged, and closed; the animal
showing a certain amount of stiffness in the action
of the hind legs. In this case we shall have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
adapt our treatment to the <i>deep champignon</i> of Zundel,
under one of its three forms of <i>extra-inguinal</i>, <i>intra-inguinal</i>,
and <i>intra-abdominal</i>.</p>

<p>Under the first head we shall often discover, upon
inquiring into the history of the case, that for a
length of time, varying from months, perhaps, to
years, the animal had been affected with a swelling
which would gather, break, and slowly heal, leaving
no mark as an apparent indication of a diseased condition,
excepting that a certain degree of lameness
would have been observed to be present. Upon exploring
the testicular region it would then be observed
to be the seat of a tumor, either spherical or
pysiform, seldom painful, and more or less adherent
to the envelope that covered it. Above this the end
may be felt free from diseased process, and this is
the champignon in its chronic form. In this condition
it is not incompatible with the general health
of the animal affected, and forms no hindrance to his
usefulness. This condition of extra-inguinal growth
will sometimes dissolve away by an abscess-formation,
and quite disappear. But if the induration of the
spermatic cord extends to the upper portion, or that
which is enclosed in the inguinal canal, in such a
manner as to interfere with locomotion, the leg corresponding
with the diseased side being carried in
abduction, with numerous fistulous tracks existing
on the surface of the scrotum, the intensity of the
symptoms varying with the extent of the diseased
process, the condition of the cord will be easily discovered
by an examination of the parts, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
presence of an <i>intra-inguinal champignon</i> established.
If, besides these symptoms, we discover by rectal
examination that there is in front of and above the
pubes a tumor more or less ovoid, or giving the
sensation of a cylindrical mass, of size varying to the
touch&mdash;which is the diseased indurated cord&mdash;the
case is judged at once to be one of <i>intra-abdominal</i>
nature. At times the inflammation may extend to
the sub-lumbar region, when the hand introduced
into the rectum may discover in that locality an
ovoid tumor or abscess which may be of great size.
This form of champignon is incomparably the most
serious of them all; an intense and persistent reactive
fever is always present, and this at length terminates
together the life and suffering of the animal.
The abscess may sometimes open externally, and in
some cases it may accumulate within the thickness
of the cord and form large collections; or, again, it
may find its way into the abdominal cavity, where it
may excite a fatal peritonitis.</p>

<p>This rapid examination of the various forms of
deep champignon will enable us easily to realize the
difficulty of the progress in the case. While the
pedunculated form, exterior to the scrotum, is not,
comparatively, a very serious matter, it becomes, on
the contrary, a very grave occurrence when it assumes
the characters of the intra-abdominal variety, and
must in a majority of cases be recognized as an incurable
disorder.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;While champignon is an affection in
which surgical interference cannot usually be dispensed<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
with, it is still essential that the surgeon
should avoid being over hasty in determining in favor
of an operation, and he should give the case a
very careful consideration before deciding upon his
course. At first emollient applications, appropriate
topical treatment, and a few points of cauterization,
may be followed by a process of resolution. But in
the event of their failure four modes of operation
present themselves. These are, in their order, the
application of the clamps; the ligature; the linear
crushing or ecraseur; and cauterization. When the
case is one of the extra-scrotal variety, the application
of a ligature around the base of the peduncle,
or removal by ecraseur, will be the simplest mode
of treatment, unless there should exist a tendency to
infiltration of the cord, in which case the manipulations
to be followed become the same as those which
are adapted to that of the deep or intra-scrotal form.</p>

<p class="caption secondary center">CURVED CLAMPS.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p><i>By the clamps.</i>&mdash;When the application of the clamps
is resorted to, they may be similar to those used in
ordinary castration, or may be curved in form (<a href="#Fig25">Fig.
25</a>). The animal to be operated on is to be thrown
on either side according to which cord is affected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span>
and an incision made through the envelopes as nearly
parallel with the median line of the body as the case
permits, when the tumor and the cord are carefully dissected
and separated from their adhesions. If the
tumor is suspended from the end of the cord there
will be no difficulty in applying the clamp above it
and upon a healthy portion of the cord. But if the
diseased process extends within the inguinal canal,
there will be need of great caution in dissecting the
cord up to the healthy structure. In doing this the
safer mode will be for the operator to treat the adhesions
with the fingers or the blunt end of the
scissors, rather than to employ the sharp edge of the
bistoury with the accompanying danger of causing
hemorrhage. If, on the contrary, the cord is diseased
to an extent that renders it difficult to reach a
healthy portion, other modes of operation&mdash;as by the
ligature&mdash;become the wiser and more practicable
indication. When the clamps are used it is necessary
to leave them in place for several days, and
sometimes they are allowed to slough off, while the
growth is usually suffered to remain for a few days
after the operation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig26">

<p class="caption main"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span></p>

<img src="images/illo097.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="83" />

<p class="caption secondary center">LIGATURE-CARRIER.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p><i>Ligature.</i>&mdash;When this mode of procedure is adopted,
the tumor having been dissected and the cord well
freed from its adhesions with surrounding parts,
and the ligature being applied, the tumor may either
be amputated immediately or be left to slough off in
its own time. The ligature may be either of twine,
silk, or elastic cord. We have ourselves operated
by this method in the successful removal of growths<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
of very considerable size. So long as the upper portion
of the cord, which retains its healthy structure,
can be reached, the application of the ligature is attended
with no difficulty, the manipulations required
being similar to those which attend the removal of
all growths by the process of ligation. But if the
diseased process extends so far that the ligature
cannot be applied at the proper point, as in the case
of intra-inguinal champignon, it will be necessary to
have resort to the ligature-carrier recommended by
Serres (<a href="#Fig26">Fig. 26</a>). In using this instrument the loop
of the ligature being passed over the tumor around
the cord, is carried into the inguinal canal as high
up as possible, pressure being made by holding the
instrument against the cord, while strong traction is
made on the ends of the ligature, which is then secured
by a knot upon a small stick placed across the
opening of the instrument, with a view to the
prevention of slipping. If an increase of pressure is
found to be necessary, it can easily be obtained by
tightening the ligature from day to day as required.
If the size of the cord should be such as to prevent
a proper application of a single ligature, it may become
necessary to divide it in applying a double,<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
triple, or multiple ligatures, in accordance with the
rules for such ligating.</p>

<p>In whatsoever manner the ligature may be applied,
even when it is of the elastic kind, the process of
sloughing of the tissues is always a slow one. It is
for this reason that we agree with Prof. Bouley in
considering the treatment of champignon by the linear
crushing very much to be preferred.</p>

<p><i>Ecraseur.</i>&mdash;The steps of the operation with this
instrument are similar to those required in the other
methods already considered. The champignon is isolated
from its surrounding parts, the chain is placed
on the cord above the base of the tumor, and the
amputation is completed by a slow pressure upon
the cord, which, crushing it by degrees, permits its
immediate removal. It must be done slowly, occupying
from ten to twenty minutes for the complete
separation of the champignon, according to the size
of the tumor. The operation being finished, the
parts are left in the condition of a simple wound,
where no cause exists to interfere with its rapid cicatrization.</p>

<p><i>Cauterization.</i>&mdash;This is a mode of treatment which
we have never had occasion to submit to trial, having
always given the preference to the process we
have just referred to. It is recommended, however,
by European authorities. Some of these advocate
the &#8220;melting&#8221; process, or the introduction of sharp
points deeply into the thickest parts of the enlargement,
while others advise a removal of a portion of
the growth and deep cauterization afterwards. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
cauterization can be advantageously employed, the
best method, in our judgment, would be the process
of amputation with Paccalin, or with the galvanic
cautery. We may here, while referring to the application
of electricity in this connection, appropriately
refer to our own experience of a number of years
ago, in treating an animal suffering with intra-scrotal
champignon, by electrolysis, and succeeding after two
applications, in obtaining the complete removal of
the tumor. This method, however, consumes too
much time to justify its employment in general practice.</p>

<h3>FISTULA OF THE SCROTUM.</h3>

<p>Being already aware of several causes of this complication
of the operation of castration, we may
readily appreciate the treatment they require. It
must be remembered that in a majority of cases, the
cause of this lesion is the presence of a foreign body
in the wound, and that until it is removed, it is in
vain to look for a cure. Prof. Bouley has reported
a case in which the fistula was due to the presence
of a pair of clamps over which the skin had almost
entirely cicatrized.</p>

<h3>INGUINAL HERNIA; HERNIA OF CASTRATION.</h3>

<p>By this is understood the protrusion of some portion
of the contents of the abdominal cavity through
the inguinal ring, either a portion of the omentum
or of some part of the small intestines, creating<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
either an epiplocele or an enterocele. This complication
may take place either during the operation,
or shortly afterwards, or at the period of the removal
of the clamps. It proceeds from the violent struggling
of the animal during the operation; to the
colics which are so apt to supervene; to his position
when placed in a stall of which the floor is too much
inclined; or it may result from some of the various
modes of castration, as, for example, the uncovered
operation.</p>

<p>At times the two forms of hernia may present
themselves together, constituting a case of
entero-epiplocele. When the epiploan alone protrudes,
it need not give rise to any unnecessary
anxiety, as it may easily be either reduced and returned
to its place, or ligated with the clamps, or
torn apart. If, on the contrary, it is a portion of the
small intestines which becomes involved, the first
indication is to restore it to its place by the proper
taxis without delay, which may be readily done,
the animal being yet down and placed under an
anesthetic, by the rectal taxis combined with the
necessary inguinal manipulations. When this has
been accomplished the intestine is kept in place by
the application of a clamp over the cord, upon which
the fibrous coat of the cremaster has been carefully
drawn.</p>

<h3>PERITONITIS.</h3>

<p>This complication, considered as one of the most
frequent following castration, is also, beyond doubt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
one of the most serious. It is generally the result of
exposure to cold, especially when its occurrence accompanies
the suppurative fever. But it also develops
itself in animals which have received the best
hygienic care, its appearance being attributed to an
excessive dragging of the cord, or to the extension
of the local inflammation by continuity of tissues.
It manifests itself generally between the second and
third day following the operation, except when it
becomes symptomatic, as of gangrene of the cord,
when we have seen it making its appearance towards
the tenth day.</p>

<p>The symptoms of this traumatic peritonitis differ
somewhat from those of the acute inflammatory type.
According to Gourdon, &#8220;the animal is dull and
refuses all food&mdash;the suppuration of the wound of
the scrotum has ceased, the bags and surrounding
parts become the seat of a warm, hard and painful
swelling. The animal stands with his four legs
brought close together, the back is stiff and arched,
the flanks are cordy, the abdomen painful, the pulse
hard, small and increased. As the disease progresses,
the symptoms are more marked, the enlargement
of the envelopes increases and is more diffuse, it extends
down to the abdomen, and even under the
chest, passes along the thighs, is less warm, less hard,
less painful, and pits under pressure. There are
slight colics, the pulse gets smaller, intermittent, the
respiration is increased, and the animal dies towards
the fifth or sixth day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The treatment to be recommended varies according<span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span>
to different authors. While some prescribe depletive
and sedative treatment, laxatives and diuretics,
many prefer tonics and stimulants. The Germans
claim great results from the use of tincture of
arnica (in small doses) administered internally. The
external treatment consists in sinapisms, warm
fomentations, poultices, or fumigations under the
abdomen.</p>

<h3>TETANUS.</h3>

<p>As with most cases of traumatic tetanus, this complication
is generally fatal, and it is, without doubt,
the most dangerous of all and marked by the greatest
mortality. It is generally admitted that exposure to
cold and dampness is one of the most prolific causes,
especially in animals which, having but recently recovered,
are too soon put to work. The various
modes of operation have also been considered to
have some influence upon its development, though
there is probably no ground upon which this theory
can find a support. Whether the nature of the soil
of a district, or its atmospheric condition, may have
any connection with it, is also a question. We know
that in some portions of Long Island, cases of tetanus
are commonly met with, at some seasons of the year,
after surgical operations of every kind. It may appear
within a few days following the castration, or it
may defer its visitation for a period of twenty days,
or longer.</p>

<p>The treatment adopted for the tetanus of castration<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
is that which is applied to all cases of that traumatic
affection.</p>

<h3>AMAUROSIS.</h3>

<p>This disease may also be included among those
classed as the sequel&aelig; of castration, having been
known to follow cases where hemorrhage of the
small testicular artery had occurred. Tonic treatment
internally and local stimulating applications
may sometimes relieve this complication, but it will
generally be admitted to be incurable.</p>

<h3>COMPARATIVE VIEW OF THE VARIOUS MODES OF
CASTRATION.</h3>

<p>The process by <i>simple excision</i>, by reason of the
hemorrhage which necessarily accompanies it, though
not inevitably dangerous, must be excluded from the
domain of general practice.</p>

<p>That of <i>scraping the cord</i> has not, so far as our
knowledge extends, been sufficiently tested, either
in European or American practice, to justify its recommendation.</p>

<p>The process of <i>torsion below the epididymis</i> is too
much subject to the development of champignon, as
well as that of <i>free torsion</i> with the hands, to be admitted
by judicious operators, while the <i>limited torsion</i>
is a method which has taken rank amongst safe
operators, notwithstanding the enormous swelling of
the parts by which it is commonly accompanied, and
the necessity it involves of the introduction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
fingers into the wound to prevent its premature
closing.</p>

<p>The method by the <i>ecraseur</i>, though occupying a
longer time in its completion than some others, has
secured very favorable results, especially in the
hands of American operators.</p>

<p>The operation by <i>cauterization</i> is highly recommended
by English veterinarians. We believe, contrary
to the statements of French authors, that it is
not widely in use on this Continent. The objections
urged against it are that the hemostatic effect upon
the cord is less reliable than in the method by the
clamps or the ligature; that there is more or less
danger of cauterizing the surrounding parts by the
effect of the radiant heat from the cautery; and that
the swelling which follows the operation is always
excessively great.</p>

<p>Castration by the <i>clamps</i> is the best known and
most extensively practised. It is easy and quick in
its performance; performs the most certain hemostasis
upon the artery, and notwithstanding some
slight objections, merits a preference over all others.
The principal objection alleged against it is that it
is attended with great pain to the suffering patient
when the pressure of the instrument upon the soft
tissues is first felt. This is a doubtful question, and
if this excessive amount of pain really exists, it certainly
cannot be of long continuance, merely on account
of the effect produced by the clamps themselves.</p>

<p>Of the various methods by <i>ligature</i>, that of the ligation
of the cord with its envelopes is applicable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
small animals only. That upon the cord alone is liable
to be followed by hemorrhage, or by the excessive
retraction of the cord into the abdominal cavity,
drawing the ligature with it. That of the efferent
canal, and of the cord by the subcutaneous mode are
not admitted in general practice, while that of the
artery alone has not been extensively performed on
large animals, so far as we are informed, except by
certain Massachusetts veterinarians.</p>

<p>The castration by <i>double subcutaneous twisting</i>, when
extensively applied to solipeds, will probably prove
to be the safest mode of all, and least likely to be
followed by complications. We are not informed as
to the extent to which it has been practised in this
country, even amongst ruminants.</p>

</div><!--chapcont-->

<p>As I have stated before, the revival of the operation
of castration upon large females is due to a
Louisiana farmer, Thomas Winn, who, in the year
1831, castrated several of his cows.</p>

<p>Without entering upon the history which includes
a record of the failures and successes attendant upon
the introduction of the operation, it may suffice to
say that until the improvements made by Charlier
in the manipulations involved in the operation, it
encountered considerable opposition, and it is within<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
a comparatively recent period that it has become
established in the domains of veterinary surgery.</p>

<p>The indications by which this operation commend
itself to agriculturists, and others who find profit or
pleasure in the use or ownership of these domestic
animals, are several. Among them are the influence
which it exercises upon the secretion of milk in cows,
and upon the power of accumulating fat, and its effects
upon the character and temper of all the large
females, in which relation it obviously acts as a
therapeutic agent, in overcoming certain peculiar
conditions by which they are distinguished. In respect
to the effect of the operation of spaying the
cow upon the milk secretion, it is a fact well established
that it not only increases the amount and duration
of the flow, but also improves the quality of
that valuable fluid, the spayed cow not only continuing
the production from eighteen to twenty-four
months, but giving a product far richer in the
elements of nutrition. This is shown by the enhanced
proportions of the cream, the caseine and the
sugar, which determine its richness and value, both
economically and commercially, after alteration.</p>

<p>But even this argument in favor of spaying the
cow is rendered more weighty by the fact that besides
its influence on the milky secretion, there is also that
which is furnished by the consideration of its effect in
augmenting the deposit of fat throughout the frame,
for it is through this tendency that the flesh of the animal
becomes so greatly improved in its nutritive quality
as compared with that of the same species when in<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
the entire condition, becoming so noticeably more tender,
juicy and palatable, retaining more of the oily
element, digesting more easily, and so, of course, acquiring
a pecuniary value in the market not before
possessed. These remarks apply to the dry equally
with the milch cow, and leaving out the reference to
the milk secretion, to the ox as well.</p>

<p>With respect to the effect of the operation upon
the character and disposition of the cow, these are
easily illustrated in the movements of the nymphomaniac
animal, which may be said to be constantly
in a state of hysterical excitement. They seem to
be in continual conditions of heat, running after and
mounting other animals with which they may be in
company, while never producing and giving no milk.
They are always in a lean condition, and must remain
a pecuniary loss to the dairyman. This manifestation
of nymphomania is also met with in the
mare, which, continually exhibiting signs of heat,
becomes more or less dangerous on that account. In
these cases the advantage of the operation of spaying
cannot be overlooked. We have personal knowledge
of several cases of this character, in which
worthless and troublesome mares have been transformed
into docile and valuable animals.</p>

<h3>CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO THE OPERATION.</h3>

<p>Charlier expresses the opinion that the best time
for the performance of the operation upon cows is
from the sixth to the eighth year, or after they have
had their second or third calf. If performed at an<span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span>
earlier period the great objection originally urged
against castration, that its performance would tend
to the diminution of the stock in numbers or &#8220;population,&#8221;
might find more or less confirmation. But
by an observance of this condition all danger of the
annihilation of stock would be obviated. The cow
to be operated on ought to be in fair condition, not
in heat or pregnant, and the time selected should
be from forty to sixty days after calving.</p>

<h3>ANATOMY.</h3>

<p>The <i>vagina</i> is situated within the pelvic cavity, between
the rectum and the bladder. Its internal face
presents numerous longitudinal folds, the purpose
of which is to permit the free dilatation of the parts.
At the bottom of the passage is situated the <i>neck of
the uterus</i>, giving to the finger the sensation of a projection,
hard towards the cavity of the vagina, and
in the centre of which is felt a closed opening, from
which radiate the folds of the mucous membrane.
The <i>uterus</i> (Figs. 27 and 28), continued forward to the
neck, is situated in the abdominal cavity, occupying
the sub-lumbar region, with its posterior extremity
resting at the end of the pelvic cavity. It is somewhat
pyriform in shape, and larger at its base, where it divides
into two lateral halves, continued by the <i>horns</i>.
The concave curvature of these horns look downward
in the cow, but face upwards in the mare. In both
they give attachment to the <i>broad ligaments</i>. These
are folds of the peritoneum, more developed forward
than behind, rising from the sub-lumbar region,<span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span>
and descending towards the uterus, to fix
themselves upon the sides of the superior face of the
body of this organ, and, as before stated, upon the
curvature of the horns. Their anterior border is
free, and gives support to the oviducts and the
ovaries. Between the serous layers are found the
utero-ovarian artery and veins, largely developed.
The <i>ovaries</i> are situated on the internal face of the
broad ligament, forming a small ovoid mass, which
receives a special serous lamella, a sort of ligament,
having between its layers a few grayish muscular
fibres, which may be strong enough to offer serious
resistance when the extirpation of the organ is attempted.</p>

<h3>MODUS OPERANDI.</h3>

<p>There are two modes of operation. The original
method was that of removal through the flanks,
which, however, has fallen into disuse since the introduction
of the process of Charlier, of removal
through the vagina. This process is altogether to
be preferred, as being safer, more consistent with
scientific surgery, and in a word is the only one
which it is proper to perform, so long as the capacity
of the vagina permits the necessary manipulations
to be performed.</p>

<h3>METHOD BY THE FLANKS.</h3>

<p>Four steps are necessary to be followed in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page111"></span><span
class="pagenum" id="Page112"></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page113"></span><span class="pagenum"
id="Page114"></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[111-<br />115]</span>
method. The first is securing the animal. The cow
is usually kept on her feet, pressed firmly against a
wall, the legs secured with hobbles, and her head
controlled, as much as possible, by a strong assistant.
The second step is the incision of the flank.
This is made on the left side, with a sharp, convex
bistoury, in the middle of the superior portion of
that region, dividing the skin and muscles vertically,
care being taken that the incision is not carried too
low down, in order to avoid the division of the circumflex
artery, which passes along in that vicinity.
An opening is then made in the peritoneum, either
with the knife or with the fingers, sufficiently large
to permit the introduction of the fingers. In the third
step of the operation, which comprehends the removal
of the ovary, the surgeon introduces his hand
into the abdomen, and turning it towards the pelvis,
feels for the horns of the uterus. Upon finding
these the ovaries are easily discovered. He carefully
draws them outwards, and their removal is effected
either with the ecraseur or the forceps of
Charlier. The operation is concluded by the application
of a quill suture.</p>

<h3>CHARLIER&#8217;S METHOD&mdash;INSTRUMENTS.</h3>

<p>For this operation special instruments are required.
These consist of, first, a vaginal dilator
(<a href="#Fig29">Fig. 29</a>), or speculum, of peculiar and somewhat
complicated construction, to be modified subsequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page116"></span><span class="pagenum"
id="Page117">[116-<br />117]</span>
by another (<a href="#Fig30">Fig 30</a>), of superior
form and easier of application, and
now in general use; second, a bistoury
cach&eacute; (<a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a>), sliding on its handles,
which is a true embryotomy knife, modified
by Colin (<a href="#Fig32">Fig. 32</a>); third, a pair of
long, sharp scissors (<a href="#Fig33">Fig. 33</a>), with
guarded blades, curved on its flat surface;
fourth, a torsion forceps (<a href="#Fig34">Fig. 34</a>),
closed by a peculiar thread arrangement,
moved by the handle; and fifth,
a steel thimble (<a href="#Fig35">Fig. 35</a>), which has been modified
by the instrument shown in <a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>, and which<span class="pagenum" id="Page118"></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[118-<br />119]</span>
is used in applying the limited torsion on the broad

<p><i>Preparation of the animal.</i>&mdash;No general preparation
is required, except one, which may be regarded as of
local effect, but is not to be overlooked. This consists
in the evacuation of the bowels by means of a rectal
injection, in order that the arms of the surgeon may
not become unnecessarily soiled during the operation.
The animal is secured on her feet by being
placed in a narrow stall to prevent her from moving
from side to side, the floor of the stall having an inclination
forwards, in order to prevent the pressure
by gravitation of the intestinal mass towards the
posterior parts of the abdomen.</p>

<p>The operation is completed in two steps, of which
the first is the incision of the vagina, and the second
the extirpation of the ovaries.</p>

<h3>THE INCISION IN THE VAGINA.</h3>

<p>This is made in the following manner. The operator
introduces the speculum with his right hand,
through the vulva, into the vaginal cavity, and carefully
passing in his left hand, well oiled, directs and
introduces the little prolongation A of the speculum
into the centre of the neck of the uterus, gently
pressing upon it in order to keep it in place. In
using the original dilator, the opening of the branches
must be so regulated as to put the walls of the vagina
upon the stretch. Or, if he uses the modified speculum,
he pushes the instrument downwards and forwards,
and by this motion distends the upper wall<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
of the cavity, keeping the instrument in that position
by a hold of the left hand, which has been withdrawn
from the vagina. He then arms himself with the
bistoury cach&eacute;, which he holds closed in his full
hand and introduces with the right hand into the
vagina. Carefully feeling the condition of the upper
wall of this cavity, and assuring himself of its being
well stretched, he rests his hand, still holding the bistoury,
upon the opening or &#8220;window&#8221; at the end of
the speculum (<a href="#Fig37">Figs. 37</a> and <a href="#Fig38">38</a>), and by firmly pushing
the blade (the sharp edge being turned backwards) out
of its handle, pierces with it the vaginal walls, about
two inches above the neck of the uterus, and with a
motion from below upwards and from before backwards,
makes an incision on the median line, from
three to three and a half inches in length. The introduction
of the instrument must be made in such
a manner that it will pass at once through the walls
of the vagina proper, as well as through the peritoneal
cap which it presents at its anterior portion.</p>

<p>The incision being completed, the speculum is
carefully withdrawn; and if a slight hemorrhage
should occur, the blood should be removed before the
surgeon proceeds to the second step of the operation.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<h3>REMOVAL OF THE OVARIES.</h3>

<p>Then, again introducing his hand into the
vagina, and passing his finger through the opening
made by the incision, he feels for the ovaries, which
he finds floating at the extremity of their ligaments,
towards the entrance of the pelvis, below, on each<span class="pagenum" id="Page121"></span><span class="pagenum"
id="Page122"></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page123"></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page124"></span><span class="pagenum"
id="Page125">[121-<br />125]</span>
side, and at a short distance from the incision, between
the base of the uterine horns, near and inside
of the free border of the ligaments, and a little above
the anterior border of the pubis. Then, grasping
the ovarian body, he draws it carefully into the
vagina, through the incision, and introduces the long
scissors, with the guarded blade of which he divides
the thick border of the broad ligament (<a href="#Fig39">Fig. 39</a>), replacing
the ovaries into the abdomen without releasing
his hold. The torsion forceps is then passed
into the vagina and through the incision, and is
made to take hold with its open jaws of the broad
ligament (<a href="#Fig40">Fig. 40</a>), above the ovary, and is firmly
closed by the movement of the spiral crank of the
handle (D). Both hands being now outside of the
vaginal cavity, and the forceps being secured on the
broad ligament, held by the right hand, the left
thumb is protected by the thimble (E), and the hand
once more inserted, to grasp the broad ligament
above the point where the jaws of the torsion forceps
are placed. In this position the torsion is made
with the forceps, the twisting of the ligament being
limited by the firm pressure made by the thimble
on the thumb with the index finger, or by a pair of
crushing pincers. After several turns of the instrument,
the ovary is separated from its attachment,
and may be brought out of the cavity, still held securely
between the oval jaws of the torsion forceps.
The same method is applicable to the ovaries of
both sides. These rules are subject to more or less
modification by indications which may occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page126"></span><span class="pagenum"
id="Page127"></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page128"></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[126-<br />129]</span>
present themselves, arising from the age of the animal
or the structure or other conditions of the ovaries.</p>

<div class="figright w300" id="Fig40">

<p class="largeillo"><a href="images/illo127lg.jpg">Larger illustration</a>.</p>

</div><!--figright-->

<p>This method of castration has been modified in
many ways, both as to the forms of the instruments
used, and the mode of using them, a majority of
operators, at the present time even, discarding the
dilator, and making the incision simply by stretching
the walls of the vagina and pushing against the
neck of the uterus with the hand. The manner in
which the removal of the ovaries is effected has also
been subjected to many changes. For more than
twenty years, during which we have been performing
the operation, we have been accustomed to use
the ecraseur in the last step, and with excellent and
satisfactory results.</p>

<p>The subsequent attention required by the spayed
cow is usually a very simple matter, and involves
little beyond careful dieting, the patient recovering
from the general effects upon the system usually in
a few days.</p>

<h3>COMPLICATIONS.</h3>

<p>It may properly be said that there are no complications
likely to follow the process in the castration
of cows, which may be denominated serious. In the
statistics which record the mortality attending it,
the fatal cases are represented at the very trifling
rate of two per cent. A light colic may sometimes
follow it, but it usually subsides without medical
treatment. Still, however, spaying may at times be
accompanied by accidents of a serious character,<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
though these have considerably diminished in frequency
since the introduction of the method of
Charlier. One of these is</p>

<h3>HEMORRHAGE,</h3>

<p class="noindent">which may occur when the torsion or the crushing of
the artery has not been sufficiently complete. But
though it is likely to give rise to peritonitis, it is not
necessarily a fatal complication. We have ourselves
known of cases of its occurrence in mares which
had survived it a number of days, and when destroyed
exhibited none of the lesions of that affection.</p>

<h3>PERITONITIS.</h3>

<p>We have several times met with this sequel to the
operation, especially in mares. But in these cases,
as revealed by <i>post mortem</i> investigation, the disease
seemed generally to have remained localized. Less
common than prior to the practice of castration per
vagina, it still is followed by fatal consequences
when the entire peritoneum becomes diseased. Its
appearance usually occurs from the third to the
sixth day. There is suspension of the milky secretion,
general dullness, chills, anorexia, suspension of
rumination, rapid, small and thready pulse, sometimes
painful respiration, rapid loss of flesh, and
speedily&mdash;death. The indications of treatment are
similar to those which are applicable to peritonitis
in the solipeds, but the prognosis is always serious.</p>

<h3>ABSCESS IN THE PELVIC CAVITY.</h3>

<p>This is a complication we have quite often encountered.
Besides the general symptoms, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span>
are those of a local character, which are detected by
rectal examination, by which discovery is made of
the presence of a tumor on one side or the other of
the vagina, varying in size, fluctuating, and easily
identified. This abscess may be opened in the
cavity of the vagina, and should be attended to as
soon as discovery is made of the fluctuating character
of the growth, without waiting for the process of
natural resolution.</p>

<h3>SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA.</h3>

<p>Emphysema of the subcutaneous connective tissue
is said to be a common sequel to the flank operation.
Its appearance need not excite any special uneasiness,
as its termination is usually by spontaneous
disappearance. It is an accident we have never encountered
in our practice.</p>

<h3>CONSTIPATION.</h3>

<p>This complication, which is often met with in
mares, is to be carefully looked for, and must be
relieved by laxative food and rectal injections. It
is due to the pain which accompanies defecation
while the wound of the vagina is healing, and which
the animal tries to avoid by keeping the rectum
full.</p>

<h3>CASTRATION OF THE SMALL ANIMALS.</h3>

<h4>SMALL RUMINANTS.</h4>

<p>For these subjects, two modes of operation are
to be principally recommended. The first is the
double subcutaneous torsion; the other the ligature<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
<i>en masse</i> of the cord and its envelopes. Having
already considered these operations, a passing
reference will suffice here.</p>

<h4>FOR SWINE.</h4>

<p>In <i>males</i>, the varying modes employed are the ligature,
limited torsion, and the clamps.</p>

<p class="caption secondary center">BISTOURY FOR THE CASTRATION OF SOW.</p>

<p class="caption tertiary center">(Division of the flank).</p>

</div><!--figleft-->

<p>In <i>females</i>, it must be remembered that the horns
of the uterus are very long and flexuous (<a href="#Fig41">Fig. 41</a>),
and that the very small ovaries are situated on the
inside of the broad ligaments, which are very large,
and allow the horns to float freely amongst the circumvolutions
of the intestines. The animal must
be prepared by being secured upon the right side
in order to expose the left flank. The incision is
made with a knife of peculiar form (<a href="#Fig42">Fig. 42</a>), the
coarse bristles having been previously closely clipped
off. Care should be taken to carry the left leg
in extension backwards, in such a manner that the
edges of the various tissues divided shall not meet
each other when the operation is completed. The
incision may be made either vertically, horizontally,
or obliquely. When vertical it should be immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page133"></span><span class="pagenum"
id="Page134"></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[133-<br />135]</span>
below the lumbar vertebra next to the last rib;
if horizontal it should be parallel with the vertebral
column. The vertical incision should be preferred,
because it brings the ovaries within easy reach of
the fingers. It should be from two to three inches
in length, and should be made by a single stroke of
the knife, and without dividing the peritoneum,
which should, afterwards, be either torn with the
finger or carefully cut while raised with the forceps.
To find the ovaries the operator introduces the index
finger of the right hand between the vertebral column
and the intestines, and explores the lumbar region.
Upon finding the ovarian sac, he presses it against
the abdominal wall and causes it to slide by pushing
towards the opening through which it is extruded
and grasped. While it is held there the left horn is
carefully drawn out after it, until arriving at the bifurcation
of the horns at the uterus, the right horn
also is brought out and the ovary on that side secured.
Both glands being now outside, they are
torn or scraped off from their attachment, and the
horns are returned to the abdomen.</p>

<p>While this process is readily applicable to young
sows, and requires a certain amount of practice to
be performed expertly and with success, it is slightly
modified when applied to older animals. In that
case the two horns must not be exposed outside together,
but each must be returned when the removal
of the ovary connected with it has been effected.</p>

<p>The simple tearing of the ovaries is not always
sufficient, and may be sometimes followed by serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span>
hemorrhage. The scraping and the torsion are safer,
and in some instances the ligature has been applied.
The incision is closed with the interrupted or, which
is preferable, the continued suture. No special
after-treatment is required beyond low diet for a few
days, with a little extra attention to cleanliness.</p>

<p>The operation may at times be rendered difficult
by exceptional and accidental conditions, as, for example,
the shortness of the fingers of the operator.
This difficulty, however, can be overcome by placing
a bundle of straw or other substance under the right
flank, which, by raising the body displaces the intestines
upwards and crowds the ovary towards the
left flank.</p>

<p>It may also happen, as sometimes with old sows,
that the ovary has become the seat of large cysts,
or that its size is increased in consequence of pathological
changes in its structure. In the first case,
the cyst may be punctured and emptied with a
trochar before attempting the obliteration of the
organ. In the second, the opening into the abdomen
must be enlarged sufficiently to permit the exit of
the extra bulk.</p>

<p>If through inadvertence the operation has been
begun while the animal is in a state of pregnancy,
the proceeding must be discontinued, the patient
kept quiet and the matter indefinitely postponed.</p>

<h4>DOGS.</h4>

<p>The <i>male</i> is altered by either the process of excision,<span class="pagenum" id="Page137"></span><span class="pagenum"
id="Page138"></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[137-<br />139]</span>
torsion, or ligature, according to the age and
size of the animal.</p>

<p>In the <i>female</i>, when, as is sometimes supposed, it
becomes a preventive measure in respect to hydrophobia&mdash;though
if it be so, it can only be from the
fact that a castrated bitch will usually remain at
home while others are running abroad in heat,
and thus being more exposed to contagion&mdash;the
operation is only justifiable in the case of house
dogs, domestic pets, in order to obviate the annoyance
caused to their owners by their demonstrations
while in heat. In the bitch the broad ligaments are
very long (<a href="#Fig43">Fig. 43</a>), extending as far as the hypochondriac
region, where they divide into an external layer,
which reaches to the last rib, while the other extends
to the sub-lumbar region behind the diaphragm.
The broad ligaments diminish in height as they
run forward in such a way that the anterior border
of the external layer where the ovary is found,
shorter in its median part, gives a certain amount of
fixity to the anterior extremity of the horns which it
keeps elevated in each hypochondriac region; on
that account both horns cannot be at one time
brought through the incision, and it becomes generally
necessary in the bitch to operate on each side.</p>

<p>The manipulations are similar to those followed in
spaying sows, with the exception that the incision is
made lower, more forward and nearer to the last rib.</p>

<h4>CASTRATION OF FOWLS.</h4>

<p>The effect of this operation upon the quality of<span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span>
the flesh and the power of accumulating fat, in the
domestic fowl is a fact too familiar to those who have
learned to appreciate the exquisite juicy quality of
the meat of the capon to need any comment at our
hands. The operation upon these animals is one of
considerable difficulty and requires skill and experience
to perform with nicety and success.</p>

<p>In birds the testicles are situated in the abdominal
cavity, immediately behind the lungs, under the
vertebral column and in front of the kidneys (Fig.
44). They correspond exactly to the articulation of
the last three ribs with the spinal column, where
they lie close together and in contact with the blood
vessels which separate them from the kidneys. They
are held in position by the peritoneum spread above
them, and by minute blood vessels, branches of the
aorta or of the vena cava.</p>

<p>In the operation the fowl is placed on his side,
the tail being towards the operator, with the hind
leg carried backwards, in order to expose the flank
of the side selected for the incision. The first step
of the operation consists in plucking the feathers
from a sufficient extent of surface, and making an
incision a little behind the lateral internal processes
of the sternum, from within outwards, and from before
backwards, and slightly oblique, through the
skin and the thin muscles of the abdomen, and when
reaching the peritoneum carefully opening it with a
puncture, having it raised with a pair of forceps.
The second step, or that which involves the extirpation
of the gland, is performed by the introduction<span class="pagenum" id="Page141"></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page142"></span><span
class="pagenum" id="Page143">[141-<br />143]</span>
of the index finger of the right hand into the abdomen,
passing it above the intestinal mass and turning
towards the dorsal region near the articulation
of the last two ribs, where the testicles are felt,
prominent at the sub-lumbar region. Then, with
the fingers half flexed, the adhesions of the organ are
broken off, and the organ, held in the bend of the
finger, is brought outside. The second testicle is
removed by the same process. If the testicles should
slip from the grasp of the finger, the accident is of
little account, as they will graft themselves upon the
walls of the abdomen, and in time disappear by resolution.
The operation is concluded by the closing
of the wound by stitches of interrupted suture, and
the healing usually takes place by first intention.</p>

<p>The operation is performed in the hen in the same
manner as with the male bird, the ovaries being
found in the lumbar region, from which they are removed
by the same manipulations that are employed
in caponing.</p>

<p>Young fowls about in their third month, are usually
selected as the victims of this epicurean barbarity.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
